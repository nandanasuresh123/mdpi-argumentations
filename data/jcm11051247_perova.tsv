					0	This study has a design flaw.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The impact of Tocilizumab on radiological changes can not be adequately analyzed without a control group not receiving the drug.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The proposed timing of Tocilizumab administration based on oxygen flow rate is interesting but undoubtedly requires a more detailed statistical analysis to convince the readers.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	If there are mutations or differences in viral strains during the course of the study, should differences in response to TOC and timing of administration depending on the strain be considered?

Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	86 cases are excluded from 187 cases, which is too many.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	What is the reason?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	When comparing different oxygen delivery methods, isn't it more appropriate to compare FiO2 rather than oxygen flow rate?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The median oxygen flow rate is shown to be 14 L/min, but FiO2 may vary depending on the method of oxygen delivery (nasal canulae, HNF, MV).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	The oxygen flow rate of 13 L/min measured by ROC as a cutoff value for TOC administration should be presented by FiO2.
					0	3.2.
					0	Comparative radiologic changes before and after TOC administration
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	In Table 2, about the change in CT findings in fatal and non-fatal patients before and after TOC administration, isn't it the same as the difference in imaging findings between patients who survive after severe illness and those who do not, regardless of TOC?
					0	3.3.
					0	Timing of TOC administration according to the oxygen flow rates
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	As mentioned above, the cutoff value is O2 13L/min, but the oxygen volume is difficult to interpret because FiO2 varies depending on the method of oxygen delivery.
					0	Thank you for improving this paper, especially regarding the timing of TOC administration.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	1	2	"Still, I disagree with the title of the paper, ""The impact of tocilizumab on radiological changes...""."
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	1	2	Without the control group, this paper does not provide evidence that the radiological changes are indeed the result of TOC.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	2	2	Therefore I would suggest the authors to change the title of their paper.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	2	2	"Something in line with ""Optimal timing of TOC administration"" would seem more appropriate."
					0	The authors adequately addressed my concerns.
					0	1 Response to Reviewer 1 Comments Point 1: This study has a design flaw.
					0	The impact of Tocilizumab on radiological changes can not be adequately analyzed without a control group not receiving the drug.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Thank you for this suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	While it would have been interesting to explore this further, our study focuses on retrospectively assessing and comparing disease progression within subgroups of patients receiving TOC.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Patients not receiving TOC would have likely had a different presentation, progression and their follow-up would be slightly out of the scope of our observational retrospective study.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	When we compared patients who received TOC with the 86 severe patients who did not receive TOC (excluded from this analysis), the TOC group was far more severe, so there is no control group that could be matched.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In addition, these patients did not have control CT scans.
					0	Point 2: The proposed timing of Tocilizumab administration based on oxygen flow rate is interesting but undoubtedly requires a more detailed statistical analysis to convince the readers.
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Following this suggestion, we have included in the analysis a calculation according to the FiO2.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	This has a cut-off which correlates to the oxygen flow cut-off.

					0	Study design and population If there are mutations or differences in viral strains during the course of the study, should differences in response to TOC and timing of administration depending on the strain be considered?
					0	Response 1:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	This is an interesting point.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	While knowledge of variants is of great importance from an epidemiologic point of view as they have different transmission rates and can cause diseases of different severity, the mechanism of the acute inflammatory response in severe infection seems to be similar regardless the strain.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	While we did not perform specific sequencing of the strain for every patient as this wouldn’t have been feasible, patients were included before the Delta variant emerged and we expect most of them to have had the initial D614G and UK B.1.1.7.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	Nonetheless, we have included a comment addressing this aspect in our limitations section to highlight this area of uncertainty.
					0	Point 2: 3.
					0	Results 86 cases are excluded from 187 cases, which is too many.
					0	What is the reason?
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	2	1	We agree with the referee that the reasons for the exclusions were unclear and have rephrased accordingly.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	2	1	Addresed in text: „All those excluded were not administered TOC either because of contraindications or TOC supply gaps.” Point 3: 3.

					0	Response 3:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	We added the data using FiO2 ROC curve.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	The area under the curve for FiO2 ROC curve was smaller than the area under the curve for oxygen flow.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	In addition, the cut-off value for FiO2 corresponded to the cut-off for the oxygen flow rate, so the two groups in Table 3 would be similar.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	4	1	We added this information also in Table 3.
					0	Point 4: 3.
					0	Results The median oxygen flow rate is shown to be 14 L/min, but FiO2 may vary depending on the method of oxygen delivery (nasal canulae, HNF, MV).
					0	Response 4:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	4	1	We analysed FiO2 (depending on the method of oxygen delivery - nasal canulae, HNF, MV), as you suggested and the cut-off value of FiO2 corresponded to the cut-off for the oxygen flow rate, so the two groups in Table 3 would be similar.
					0	We added this information also in Table 3.
					0	Point 5: 3.
					0	Results 2 The oxygen flow rate of 13 L/min measured by ROC as a cutoff value for TOC administration should be presented by FiO2.
					0	Response 5:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	5	1	Addressed in text and in Table 3.
					0	Point 6: 3.2.
					0	Comparative radiologic changes before and after TOC administration In Table 2, about the change in CT findings in fatal and non-fatal patients before and after TOC administration, isn't it the same as the difference in imaging findings between patients who survive after severe illness and those who do not, regardless of TOC?
					0	Response 6:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	6	1	Thank you for pointing this out, we have changed Table 1 accordingly and we removed the imaging data, which as you mentioned, was the same as “before TOC” in Table 2.
					0	Point 7: 3.3.
					0	Timing of TOC administration according to the oxygen flow rates As mentioned above, the cutoff value is O2 13L/min, but the oxygen volume is difficult to interpret because FiO2 varies depending on the method of oxygen delivery.
					0	Response 7:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	7	1	Addressed, see previous comments and answers.
