Attached below is our detailed response to the comments on our manuscript.
We have attached a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised by the reviewers.
The revised parts in the manuscript are indicated by red characters.
Reviewer #1: Comment: The manuscript by Sharmin Akther Rupa et al, the manuscript has many serious concerns on the basis that it cannot be accepted in this journal.
for example, 13C NMR must be 100 MHz not 400 MHz, value must be either ascending order or descending order (13C NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 14.82 (-CH3), 149.25 (-C=N-), 153.65 (Ar-C), 125.26 (Ar-C), 140.31 (Ar-C),159.11 (C=O), 130.04 (Ar-C), 112.83 (Ar-C), 109.34 (Ar-C), 123.05 (Ar-C).
above example showed the manuscript not written carefully.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and comments.
We corrected the above-mentioned correction as suggested by the reviewer and presented as follows, 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): δ 11.43 (s, 2H), 8.34 (m, 2H), 8.28 (m, 1H), 7.65 (d, 2H, J = 4.8 Hz), 7.61 (d, 2H, J = 3.2 Hz), 7.14 (t, 2H, J = 8.8 Hz), 2.51 (s, 6H).
13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 159.44 (C=O), 154.55 (Ar-C), 148.91 (Ar-C), 143.22 (-C=N-), 140.48 (Ar-C), 130.06 (Ar-C), 129.44 (Ar-C), 128.20 (Ar-C), 125.75 (Ar- C), 15.32 (-CH3).
Comment: Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Both compounds are biologically active, but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and agree with the reviewer that the computational and experimental results of antimicrobial activity differ to some extent in this part of the study and required further investigation to understand why such activity differs to the ligands by other means in the future.
In this study, we successfully synthesized the novel ligands and studied its spectroscopy with other probable studies.
Fortunately, we have found outstanding results during the chemo-sensor study and hopefully, we could be able to show the excellent usage of the ligands as a chemo-sensor in near future.
Also, we are planning to do a fluorescence imaging study of protein-ligands.
Comment: Third one their binding study: 1.
Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u?
As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments.
2.
Docking is a preliminary experiment.
How did the author validate the docking protocol?
The authors are suggested using some decoy ligands and calculating the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments.
In addition, authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis.
3.
The pdb id 4j6u does not contain any bound ligand.
How did the author select the binding site?
If a few sets of amino acids were considered to define the binding site, then on what basis they select them?
4.
The authors did not report any Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition assay, they are requested to justify Tyrosinase inhibition as the probable mechanism of action for these sets of ligands by providing suitable literature references.
Response: We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and the following are the answers in response to the question for the kind consideration of the reviewer- Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis, which is essential for pigmentation.
Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer.
It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-103].
That’s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium was performed.
Also, molecular docking with other proteins of B. Megaterium was conducted, but 46ju provided better binding affinity with the synthesized compounds.
For this reason, we aim to study the structure of tyrosinase from the bacteria.
Preliminary antimicrobial studies were carried out to validate the docking protocol.
At present, we are doing the fluorescence activities of these ligands and L2 showed excellent fluorescent emission at λmax 520 nm.
So, we hope that we will carry out ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments and 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability in the future for our next study since within this shortest time, we are unable to do these experiments.
The active binding site of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp.
The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation.
We have included this in the manuscript as follows: 4.9.
Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96].
To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-100].
4.9.1.
Binding affinity of L1 and L2 The highest anti-bacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1.
The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were calculated by AutoDock Vina.
The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in the Fig.
6.
In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1.
Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively.
Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl).
L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig.
6).
Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively.
Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala44A, and ALA44B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which also supports the literature [101-103].
Thus, computational results are in good agreement with in vitro antibacterial behaviour of our compounds for novel antibacterial drug design.
We also revise the whole manuscript to make the language and grammar better as suggested by the reviewer.

Attached below is our detailed response to the comments on our manuscript.
We have attached a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised by the reviewers.
The revised parts in the manuscript are indicated by red characters.
Reviewer Comment: The paper need more attention from the side of the authors.
- The abstract is somehow unorganized.
Even if it is an unstructured abstract, it should respond to the following point one after the other.
Background, aims, methods, results, and conclusion - The background is missing.
- The aims are not clearly presented.
- Methods should be written in brief before presenting the results.
- Results they took the most of your abstract.
Please be brief; most of the text is not important for a reader who only wants to get an idea about your paper before reading it.
Just put your key results in brief.
- The conclusion is missing.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and rewrite the abstract as follows, Polytopic organic ligands with hydrazone moiety are in the forefront of new drug research among many others due to their unique and versatile functionality and ease of strategic ligand design.
Quantum chemical calculations of these polyfunctional ligands can be carried out in silico to determine the thermodynamic parameters.
In this report two new tritopic dihydrazide ligands, N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(thiophen-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L1) and N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L2) were successfully prepared by the condensation reaction of pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylic hydrazide with 2-acetylthiophene and 2-acetylpyrrole.
The FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR as well as mass spectra of both L1 and L2 were recorded and analyzed.
Quantum chemical calculations were performed at DFT/B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311+ G (d, p) level of theory to study the molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies, and thermodynamic properties including changes of ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G for both the ligands.
The optimized vibrational frequency and (1H and 13C) NMR obtained by B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311 + G (d, p) showed good agreement with experimental FT-IR and NMR data.
Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations were also conducted to find the HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO–LUMO gaps of the two synthesized compounds.
To investigate the biological activities of the ligands, L1 and L2 were tested in vitro bioassays against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus strain.
In addition, Molecular ‪docking was used to study the molecular behavior of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.
The outcomes revealed that both L1 and L2 can suppress microbial growth of bacteria and fungi with variable potency.
The antibacterial activity results demonstrated the compound L2 to be potentially effective against Bacillus Megaterium with inhibition zones of 12 mm while molecular docking study showed the binding energies for L1 and L2 to be −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1 respectively with tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.‪ - Font of the reference is different from the text Response: We appreciate the recommendation and corrected the font of the references.
- This sentence “‪Polytopic ligands containing hydrazide-hydrazone moiety (—CO—NHN=CH—) are important for new drug development” should be better connected to the next one to explain why they are important for new drug development?
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and corrected the section as below: Polytopic ligands containing hydrazide-hydrazone moiety (—CO—NHN=CH—) are important for new drug development [1-6].
Because, their polyfunctional nature offer multifarious synthetic ways to derivatize such organic molecules towards suitable and effective drug-receptor interaction.
The derivatives of hydrazide-hydrazone moiety specially with heterocyclic system possess a range of biological activities namely, anti-microbial, anti-mycobacterial, antitubercular, anticonvulsant, anticholinesterase [1], antiplatelet, and more importantly antitumor [5,7].
Transition metal complexes derived from such type of ligands have been widely studied since they also demonstrate significant biological and pharmacological properties [8-11].
- Replace “‪In addition to that, the compounds were tested in vitro bioassays against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive ‪bacteria and the fungus strain showing specially promising results for L2.
Molecular docking methodology was used to study molecular behavior of L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium to identify their binding interactions” with “‪In addition to that, the compounds were tested in vitro against Gram-negative and positive ‪bacteria and two fungi.
Molecular ‪docking was used to study the molecular behavior of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.‪ Response: We appreciate the recommendation and corrected the section as below: This Section is corrected as “‪In addition to that, the compounds were tested in vitro against Gram-negative and positive ‪bacteria and two fungi.
Molecular ‪docking was used to study the molecular behavior of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.’’ Section 2.3.1.
Reference for the used strains is required.
Why are those specific strains used?
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and added the required references as below.
We have these specimens of strains available in our lab to study.
Therefore, we used.

We are showing our sincere apology for such mistakes.
The changes are added as follows, 2.1.3.
Antimicrobial activity assay In vitro antimicrobial activity of synthesized ligands was evaluated by agar disc diffusion method [40].
Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used as a control medium for testing against bacteria and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used for fungal strain.
After preparation, the MHA and PDA medias were incubated for 24 h and contaminations were checked.
After incubation, the test organism was inoculated using sterile cotton bar on media.
The sample discs were put gently on pre-inoculated agar plates and aerobically incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for antibacterial and for 48 h at 26 °C for antifungal assay.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as control.
Each disc was loaded with 25 µL of sample solution in DMSO containing 300 µg of synthesized compounds.
10 µL of ceftriaxone and amphotericin-B solutions containing 50 µg each in DMSO were loaded per disc for antibacterial and antifungal assays as positive control, respectively.
The diameter of the inhibition zones in mm circling the disc were measured.
Two gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (cars-2) and Bacillus Megaterium (BTCC-18), two gram-negative Escherichia coli (carsgn-2) and Salmonella Typhi (K-323130) bacteria, and two fungal strains Trichoderma harzianum (carsm-2) and Aspergillus niger (carsm-3) were used in this study.

- Conclusion: Repeated abstract.
The conclusion must remind the reader why the article was written in the first place and why it is important in the field.
The conclusion should briefly give an insight into the obtained results and also the limitations.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and changed the conclusion as follows, Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years.
In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry.
Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done.
The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results.
We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G of the ligands.
The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules.
Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable.
To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent.
The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view.
We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands.
We also revise the whole manuscript to make the language and grammar better as suggested by the reviewer.

Author Response Manuscript ID #: Molecules 1583723 Journal: Molecules A detailed point-by-point response to the reviewers' comments We would like to thank the reviewers for the comments and endorsements of our work.
Attached below is our detailed response to the comments on our manuscript.
We have attached a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised by the reviewers.
The revised parts in the manuscript are indicated by red characters.
Reviewer: Comment: The effort made by the authors during the first round of revision is clear and the paper was improved greatly.
Nevertheless, some points were not addressed properly.
The molecular study needs a control molecule to compare the results of L1 and L2.
how would we know that −7.7 and −8.8 are good scores or not?
Either perform a quick analysis for a molecule known for its tyrosinase inhibition or compare with other studies control that used the same methods in your paper.
For example, in this study "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.078" they used Arbutin to compare the results of their studied molecule.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and rewrote the Molecular Docking study as follows as suggested by the reviewer, 4.9.
Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding of ligand-receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [92-95].
To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analyses of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [96-99].
The docking results were also compared with well-testified inhibitor arbutin [97].
4.9.1.
Binding affinity of L1 and L2 The highest antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1.
The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, whereas for arbutin-4j6u the value was -9.1 kcal mol-1 which were calculated by AutoDock Vina.
The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in Fig.
6.
It was observed that arbutin formed six conventional hydrogen bonds with 4j6u (Supplementary Fig.
S11) by the following residues: ALA40A (one O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), Glu141A (four O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), and LYS47B (one O-H----O-C hydro-gen bond).
Also several hydrophobic interactions were found with ILE139A, ILE39A, and ALA40A.
In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1.
Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively.
Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl).
L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig.

Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively.
Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala40A, Ala44A, ALA44B and Lys47B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which are in close vicinity to the control arbutin and supports the literature [100-102].

All both compounds are biologically active but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.

The manuscript by Sharmin Akther Rupa et al is a comprehensive study on Synthesis of Novel Tritopic Hydrazone Ligands: Spectroscopy,Biological activity, DFT, and Molecular docking Studies.
Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized topresent a wide range of biological activities in recent years.
In this present study wehave synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and massspectrometry.
Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also doneThis manuscript is suitable publication in Molecules.
The effort made by the authors during the first round of revision is clear and the paper was improved greatly.
nevertheless some points were not addressed properly.
1.
The molecular study needs a control molecule to compare the results of L1 and L2.
how would we know that −7.7 and −8.8 are good scores or not.
Either perform a quick analysis for a molecule known for its tyrosinase inhibition or compare with other studies control that used the same methods in your paper.For exemple in this study "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.078" they used Arbutin to compare the results of their studied molecule.

Attached below is our detailed response to the comments on our manuscript.
We have attached a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised by the reviewers.
The revised parts in the manuscript are indicated by red characters.
Reviewer #1: 1.
Comment: The manuscript by Sharmin Akther Rupa et al, the manuscript has many serious concerns on the basis that it cannot be accepted in this journal.
for example, 13C NMR must be 100 MHz not 400 MHz, value must be either ascending order or descending order (13C NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 14.82 (-CH3), 149.25 (-C=N-), 153.65 (Ar-C), 125.26 (Ar-C), 140.31 (Ar-C),159.11 (C=O), 130.04 (Ar-C), 112.83 (Ar-C), 109.34 (Ar-C), 123.05 (Ar-C).
above example showed the manuscript not written carefully.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and comments.
We corrected the above-mentioned correction as suggested by the reviewer and presented as follows, 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): δ 11.43 (s, 2H), 8.34 (m, 2H), 8.28 (m, 1H), 7.65 (d, 2H, J = 4.8 Hz), 7.61 (d, 2H, J = 3.2 Hz), 7.14 (t, 2H, J = 8.8 Hz), 2.51 (s, 6H).
13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 159.44 (C=O), 154.55 (Ar-C), 148.91 (Ar-C), 143.22 (-C=N-), 140.48 (Ar-C), 130.06 (Ar-C), 129.44 (Ar-C), 128.20 (Ar-C), 125.75 (Ar- C), 15.32 (-CH3).

Comment: Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Both compounds are biologically active, but their activity was moderate which did not support their 2 efforts.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and agree with the reviewer that the computational and experimental results of antimicrobial activity differ to some extent in this part of study and required further investigation to understand why such activity differ to the ligands by other means in future.
In this study, we successfully synthesized the novel ligands and studied its spectroscopy with other probable studies.
Fortunately, we have found outstanding results during chemo-sensor study and hopefully we could be able to show the excellent usage of the ligands as a chemo-sensor in near future.
Also, we are planning to do fluorescence imaging study of protein-ligands.
3.
Comment: Third one their binding study: 1.
Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u?
As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments.
2.
Docking is a preliminary experiment.
How did the author validate the docking protocol?
The authors are suggested to use some decoy ligands and calculate the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments.
In addition, authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis.
3.
The pdb id 4j6u does not contain any bound ligand.
How did the author select the binding site?
If a few sets of amino acids were considered to define the binding site, then on what basis they selected them?
4.
The authors did not report any Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition assay, they are requested to justify Tyrosinase inhibition as the probable mechanism of action for these sets of ligands by providing suitable literature references.
Response: We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and following are the answers in response to the question for the kind consideration of the reviewer- Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis, which is essential for pigmentation.
Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer.
It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic 3 adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme 97-103.
That’s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
Also, molecular docking with other proteins of B. Megaterium were conducted, but 46ju provided better binding affinity with the synthesized compounds.
For this reason, we aim to study structure of tyrosinase from the bacteria.
Preliminary antimicrobial studies were carried out to validate the docking protocol.
At present, we are doing the fluorescence activities of these ligands and L2 showed excellent fluorescent emission at λmax 520 nm.
So, we hope that we will carry out ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments and 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability in future for our next study, since within this shortest time, we are unable to do these experiments.
The active binding site of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp.
The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation.
We have included this in the manuscript as follows: 4.9.
Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96].
To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-100].
4.9.1.
Binding affinity of L1 and L2 The highest anti-bacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1.
The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were calculated by AutoDock Vina.
The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in the Fig.
6.
In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1.
Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were 4 also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively.
Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl).
L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig.
6).
Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively.
Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala44A, and ALA44B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which also supports the literature [101-103].
Thus, computational results are in good agreement with in vitro antibacterial behaviour of our compounds for novel antibacterial drug design.
We also revise the whole manuscript to make the language and grammar better as suggested by the reviewer.

Response: We appreciate the recommendation and rewrite the abstract as follows, 2 Polytopic organic ligands with hydrazone moiety are in the forefront of new drug research among many others due to their unique and versatile functionality and ease of strategic ligand design.
Quantum chemical calculations of these polyfunctional ligands can be carried out in silico to determine the thermodynamic parameters.
In this report two new tritopic dihydrazide ligands, N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(thiophen-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L1) and N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L2) were successfully prepared by the condensation reaction of pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylic hydrazide with 2-acetylthiophene and 2-acetylpyrrole.
The FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR as well as mass spectra of both L1 and L2 were recorded and analyzed.
Quantum chemical calculations were performed at DFT/B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311+ G (d, p) level of theory to study the molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies, and thermodynamic properties including changes of ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G for both the ligands.
The optimized vibrational frequency and (1H and 13C) NMR obtained by B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311 + G (d, p) showed good agreement with experimental FT-IR and NMR data.
Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations were also conducted to find the HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO–LUMO gaps of the two synthesized compounds.
To investigate the biological activities of the ligands, L1 and L2 were tested in vitro bioassays against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus strain.

- This sentence “ ) — NHN=CH — CO — hydrazone moiety ( - containing hydrazide Polytopic ligands are important for new drug development” should be better connected to the next one to explain why they are important for new drug development?
Response: 3 We appreciate the recommendation and corrected the section as below: Polytopic ligands containing hydrazide-hydrazone moiety (—CO—NHN=CH—) are important for new drug development [1-6].
Because, their polyfunctional nature offer multifarious synthetic ways to derivatize such organic molecules towards suitable and effective drug-receptor interaction.
The derivatives of hydrazide-hydrazone moiety specially with heterocyclic system possess a range of biological activities namely, anti-microbial, anti-mycobacterial, antitubercular, anticonvulsant, anticholinesterase [1], antiplatelet, and more importantly antitumor [5,7].
Transition metal complexes derived from such type of ligands have been widely studied since they also demonstrate significant biological and pharmacological properties [8-11].

Protein-ligand Docking 3.2.1.
Ligand and Protein preparation: The structures of L1 and L2 have been fully optimized by using Gaussian 09 software at B3LYP/6-311G+ (d, p) level.
The 3D crystal structure of tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u; resolution: 2.5Å, Chain A, B) was obtained in pdb format from online RCSB protein data bank (PDB) database.
The structure was verified, and an energy minimization was performed with the Swiss-Pdb Viewer software packages (version 4.1.0) [44], since the crystal structure contains a variety of issues related to improper bond order, side chains geometry, and missing hydrogen atoms.
Prior to docking, all the heteroatoms and water molecules were removed from the crystal structure using PyMol (version 1.3) software packages [45].
The active binding pocket of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp—having the highest pocket area and volume are 95.432 Å2 and 137.877 Å3, respectively [46].
The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation.
Both the structures of the proteins and ligands were saved in .pdbqt format by AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2, May 11, 2011) for docking analysis [47].

- Conclusion: Repeated abstract.
The conclusion must remind the reader why the article was written in the first place and why it is important in the field.
The conclusion should briefly give an insight into the obtained results and also the limitations.
Response: We appreciate the recommendation and changed the conclusion as follows, 9 Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years.
In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry.
Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done.
The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results.
We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G of the ligands.
The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules.
Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable.
To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent.
The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view.
We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands.
We also revise the whole manuscript to make the language and grammar better as suggested by the reviewer.
