Meeks (University of California, USA), Guest Editors of Special Issue “Cyanobacteria: Ecology, Physiology and Genetics” Received: 2 June 2014 First Revision Received: 9 August 2014 Accepted: 14 August 2014 Published: 3 September 2014 First Round of Evaluation Round 1: The authors present a model for the gliding motility of filamentous cyanobacteria, which involves elastic, gliding, and contact/cohesion forces.
					0	Simulations using the model address the observation of reticulate patterns in experiments with filamentous cyanobacteria.
					0	The authors find that for a certain parameter regime, they observe in their simulations patterns with characteristics similar to the characteristics of the experimental patterns.
					0	They also make quantitative measurements to describe the behaviour of the model trichomes.
					0	The model is successful in producing local alignment of filaments and some sharp bends—both characteristics of the experimental system.
					0	They also explore behaviour in much of the available parameter space.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	However, their parameterization of the bending modulus is not acceptable because it leads to an unreasonably large (0.5 metre) persistence length for a bacterial trichome.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	As a result, I do not recommend that this paper should be published in its current form.
					0	While the authors might be able to find a similar phenomenological agreement with more reasonable parameters, it will change all of their results and amounts to a substantial revision.
					0	R2 Critical issue: (1)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The literature seems to indicate a low value of the bending modulus (alpha) that corresponds to a persistence length of 500 microns.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors instead use alpha = 2 × 10−21 Nm2, which is 1000× larger.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	With this value, the persistence length = alpha/(kbT) = 0.5 metres.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	This seems orders of magnitude too large, especially in the face of the results of Boal and Ng [44].
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors need to be in a physical regime of parameter space in order to confront their results with observed patterns.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Otherwise, they are just fitting a non-linear phenomenon with a (potentially inappropriate) non-linear model— in this case agreement does not provide firm insight into the physical system.
					0	Other issues: (2)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	In Section 3.3 the authors describe how an increase in system size indicated that one of the results presented earlier in the paper (at beta = 0.5) was an artifact of a smaller system size.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	This brings into question all results at the smaller system size, potentially including all the quantitative results of the paper.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The authors should be able to argue that the other results will not depend on system size.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The correlation length in Figure 3b is by eye more than the system size, indicating a potential qualitative change with increasing system size (which the authors find).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The correlation length in other figures is less than the system size, indicating that they may be fine.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The authors need to add some of this discussion to reassure the reader.
					0	(3)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors find that results at beta = 0 are most similar to the experimental reticulate patterns.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	In the force model, there are three forces: elastic, gliding, and contact/cohesion.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The contact/cohesion force is presented in equation 12, and is proportional to epsilon.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	After Equation 23, the authors define beta = epsilon/(zeta⋅v0), implying that there will be no contact/cohesion forces when beta = 0.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	However, in the results of Figures 3, 4, and 5 the results for beta = 0 clearly show interactions between the filaments.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The fourth paragraph of section 2.9 describes a hard-core interaction, which appears to be the source of the patterns when beta = 0.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	This hard-core interaction should be mentioned after Equation 12, since it is not simply an implementation issue but the dominant interaction with beta = 0.
					0	(4)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	All the results depend on the cohesion forces, which are described by a Lennard–Jones function in Equation 12, in Section 2.5.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	However, this way of approximating cohesion is not well justified, and in Section 2.9 (several sections later) the authors mention that in reality the attractive force “does not really exist” and that the trichomes cohere after contact.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	The authors are using an LJ interaction to approximate contact adhesion.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	They should say why, and address how good of an approximation they expect this to be.
					0	Other minor issues: (5)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	In Section 2.4, it is stated that a stochastic process determines P, but no details are given.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	There should be some description, if brief, for this process.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	What distribution is used?
					0	(6)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	The authors mention in the discussion that they may get stronger results for a deeper system, or for trichomes that may only glide freely near a surface or other trichome.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	In terms of the understanding gained from the modelling/simulations, how would these lead to qualitative changes in the observed patterns?
					0	R3 (7)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	The viscosity mu = 1 Pa s is used.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	This value is approximately 1000 times higher than the viscosity of water, which is the environment of filamentous cyanobacteria.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	A reference is given, but there should also be a brief justification in the text.
					0	(8)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	The authors do not include a description of the reaction force for the top and bottom planes.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	A brief explanation would be appropriate.
					0	(9)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	None of the references at the end of the paper contain journal volume or page numbers.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	They should.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	11	0	2	In general, and especially in the introduction, many statements are made without accompanying references.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	These are not referred to in the text.
					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 1 We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to do a thorough review of our paper.
					0	In response to the reviewers’ comments: (1) We initially attempted to use the bending modulus implied from Boal and Ng’s study, however we found that during simulations this value seemed to be too low.
					0	The trichomes were completely flaccid and would collapse into a heap as soon as one collided with another trichome, unlike the smooth sinuous shape filamentous cyanobacteria often display.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	In the paper we justify (at some length) the bending modulus we used, which we extrapolated from various sources, and explain why we believe the value in Boal and Ng’s study is likely too low.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The reviewer did not question the logic or the sources used to arrive at this value, but nevertheless seemed surprised at the result.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The reviewer claims that the parameter falls outside of the physical regime, but doesn’t offer a justification other than that the implied persistence length “seems too large”.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	However, the large persistence length simply implies that the cyanobacteria are stiff enough that they are largely unaffected by thermal fluctuations.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	Despite this, the trichomes in our simulations are still quite flexible in practice, as can be seen in Figure 4.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	Even if the virtual trichomes are somewhat too stiff, we do not feel that this would have a major impact on the results.
					0	(2)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	3	1	We added the following statement to the end of Section 3.3: “The simulation results of the previous section for β > 0.5 are unlikely to be affected by the domain size, however, since the features in those simulations are on a much smaller scale than the domain size and are also more chaotic, as seen in the correlation length and the global alignment (Figure 5a,d).”
					0	(3)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	4	1	We added the following clarification to the end of the non-dimensionalization section: “In the subsequent sections, simulations for β = 0 use a modified interaction force such that there is no cohesion, but the hard core repulsion is maintained, i.e., 0 0 c F = for 0 h ≥ , otherwise 0 c c F F = with β = 0.125.” (4)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	5	1	We added two references to justify using the Lennard–Jones potential.
					0	(5)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	6	1	We added the following clarification: “This is simulated by generating a pseudo-random number x following a uniform distribution X ~ U(0,1), and reversing the gliding direction if x < ω⋅∆t.
					0	R4 (6)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	7	1	We amended the following sentences of the discussion: “These differences may be due to the fact that we use a shallow domain (7.5 microns) to reduce the simulation run time, which may cause the pattern to be “squashed” as the domain ceiling prevents ridges from growing vertically” “Restricting the virtual trichomes such that they may only glide when in contact with the substratum or another trichome may promote further aggregation of the trichomes from streams into ridges, as a trichome would be less likely to successfully break away from a stream because it would lose much of its propulsive force as it lost contact with neighboring trichomes and/or the substratum.”
					0	(7)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	8	1	We added the following sentence to Section 2.4: “Gliding requires contact with some (semi-)solid substrate in order to provide a reaction force to the gliding mechanism.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	8	1	We assume that the trichomes are immersed in highly viscous medium that allows them to glide freely in all directions.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	8	1	This medium could consist of the EPS the trichomes produce copiusly when gliding [Hoiczyk2000].” (8)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	9	1	The exact force is now given.
					0	(9)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	10	1	The bibliography now has volume and page numbers.
					0	(10)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	11	1	The reviewer did not provide any examples where he/she felt a reference was warranted.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	11	1	We cited 55 sources, which we feel offers reasonable background and justification for our assumptions.
					0	(11)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	12	1	References to the movies were added to the results section.
					0	Round 1: The authors develop and analyze a model for the dynamics of filamentous bacteria gliding in two dimensions.
					0	Qualitative comparisons are made to the fossil record and modern experiments.
					0	I have a few comments, suggestions, and questions.
					0	I do not feel that any of these points demand major changes to the manuscript, which is generally fine in the present form.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	(1) Notation: • L is used both for the length of the trichome Nl and in the non-dimensionalization as 0 αν ζ .
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	• I have never seen , ⋅⋅used to define an edge.
					0	It looks like an inner product.
					0	Is this standard?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	• In Equations (5)–(8), is there any difference between subscripts and superscripts?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	• It is confusing that b κ is a vector that is not simply related to b. I initially thought that κ was a new parameter.
					0	Similarly, it is odd that e is a vector and [e] is a matrix.
					0	Why not use the Levi–Civita tensor?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	• ˆ h looks like a unit vector parallel to h. Is there a reason that h only has a ˆ ⋅ in Equation (12)?
					0	(2)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Walter (ref 7) describes the formation of “clumps” which are very similar to the structures describes by Shepard.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Shepard and Sumner provide better images (Walter only shows sketches), but it might be worth mentioning that the phenomenon is more general.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	As I recall, Petroff et al.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	(ref 13) show similar patterns.
					0	R5 (3)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	In the force balance, the drag coeffcient is assumed to be the viscosity of water.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	Since the cells glide over a surface and next to other cells, it would seem that cell–cell friction and cell–surface friction might be at least as important as hydrodynamic drag.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	What about the viscosity of the material used in the “slime jet”?
					0	(4)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Following Equation (13), it is stated that “The interpolation ensures the net force and net torque of the interaction forces are null”.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	This confuses me so I suspect that I have misunderstood something.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	In an overdamped system, such as this one, all forces and torques are balanced by drag on the cell.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Is this all that is happening in this derivation?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	The text reads like certain forces and torques are assumed to vanish.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Are these forces and torques introduced by the interpolation and the parameterization is chosen to cancel artifacts?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Or, are there internal forces and and torques acting on the vertices that cancel as a result of Newton’s second law?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Please clarify this point.
					0	(5)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	In the estimation of the Young’s modulus it is assumed that the bending resistance is due to the cell wall.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	I suspect that this is a very poor approximation, accounting for the two order of magnitude difference between the estimated and benchmark values of Y.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	It would seem that the resistance is controlled or at least influenced by additional factors such as protein expression (notably MreB) and osmotic pressure.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	If my intuition is wrong (I am not an expert on cell morphology), I would appreciate knowing why.
					0	(6)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	If I understand correctly, there are six important length scales in the problem, the size of the domain DH , the spacing between trichomes 13 ρ − , 0 , , L l αν ζ = Θ, and the trichome length L = Nl (also denoted L in the manuscript), giving five dimensionless numbers.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	However, in the non-dimensionalization, the authors state that there are only two parameters: ρ and Nl γ θ = .
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	Unless I am mistaken, there are additional parameters like l/L, Nl/D, and N that the authors hold fixed but may influence the details of the numerics.
					0	(7)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	It seems a little odd to posit an attractive force in the derivation (Equation (12)) and then ignore/dismiss it in the numerics (“… in reality the attractive force does not really exist, trichomes only cohere after they have come into contact” page 12).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	Clearly, this is done to (quite reasonably) avoid modeling steric interactions with hard bodies.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	It was a little distracting to think that sticky adhesion was decaying like 6 ( ) h Θ .
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	Perhaps note after Equation (12) that the attractive force decreases to zero at a finite distance in the numerics.
					0	(8)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	12	0	2	The parameter space is rather large, and only a small subspace is explored in the numerics.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	12	0	2	This is fine, but it leaves a lot of interesting questions un-addressed.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	12	0	2	For example, is the transition from broad streams (Figure 4a) to loops (Figure 4d) continuous or are there bifurcations/phase transitions?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	Can you coarse grain this model to make it analytically tractable?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	The basic phenomena suggest something like an active shear-thinning uid?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	This would make it easier to understand the bifurcations in the dynamics and may require fewer parameters.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	Just something to think about.
					0	(9)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	In this model, the density of cells is assumed to be constant.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	However, the timescale of the simulations is comparable to the doubling time of many bacteria.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	Because cell density is found to R6 be important in determining the morphology of communities, I suspect that reproduction is important in understanding the patterns.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	This point might be worth addressing in the text.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	Notably, the introduction of reproduction does not introduce another parameter.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	As I recall, these cyanobacteria reproduce (with doubling time τ ) by adding cells to the filament and that filaments periodically break (rate k+).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	Thus, the length of a filament is not a model parameter.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	Rather, length is determined dynamically as ~ N k τ + (10)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	16	0	2	This project would benefit immeasurably from a quantitative comparison to experiments.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	16	0	2	I understand that this is beyond the scope of this paper, but I strongly encourage future work in this direction.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	In the introduction, this project is put into the context of stromatolites.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	In the discussion/conclusion, I would appreciate to hear the authors thoughts on what this model teaches us about stromatolites.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	In the current form I am left to conclude only that communities of filamentous bacteria can develop reticulated patterns similar to forms observed in the fossil record.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	This conclusion does not offer much more than Shepard’s experimental observation of this result.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	Can we use the details of this model to, for example, estimate the cohesion β of ancient cells?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	Do these results provide any insight into the identity of stromatolite building cells.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	As far as I can tell, nothing in this model suggests that photosynthesis (much less oxygenic photosynthesis) is required to form these patterns.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	It seems that this model shows that polygonal patters are a generic feature of elongated gliding cells and is independent of metabolism.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	A quick google search produced this video of mat of the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Beggiatoa spp.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	http://vimeo.com/57205513 (note: I have no idea of the details of these observations so any similarity may be spurious).
					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 2 We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her thorough review of our manuscript and thoughtful comments.
					0	In response to the reviewers’ comments: (1)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	The symbol used to denote trichome length was changed to an uppercase lambda.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	The , ⋅⋅ is often used to denote a tuple in computer science, in this case a pair.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	The superscripts should have been subscripts.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	The notation used in Equations (5)–(8) was adopted from Bergou et al’s paper.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	h-hat is in fact a unit vector parallel to h, and we’ve clarified the text to this point.
					0	(2)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	6	1	We added a few sentences to the introduction that expand a bit on similar structures in the Petroff and Walter references.
					0	(3)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	7	1	Actually, as Reviewer 1 noted, we use a viscosity that is 1000 times greater than that of water (following Wolgemuth et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	7	1	2005), for the very reasons the reviewer mentioned.
					0	(4)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	8	1	The statement has been clarified and is now: “The sum of the interaction’s opposing forces and torques is zero, thereby ensuring Newton's third law is respected.”
					0	(5)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	9	1	Our estimate is simplistic, however we were unable to find a reliable measurement of this parameter in the literature, and so we resorted to some simple extrapolations.
					0	(6)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	10	1	There are indeed additional parameters.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	10	1	We have added a complete list to Section 2.8.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	10	1	Many are explored to some extent in the results (beta, reversal frequency, domain dimensions, trichome R7 density), whereas most of the physical characteristics of the trichomes are known from published sources (diameter, length, gliding speed, bending modulus), and finally N was simply chosen so that trichomes had a “smooth” appearance.
					0	(7)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	22	11	1	To avoid confusion on this point we have replaced this statement with the following: “We find that these errors are infrequent and acceptable as a trade-off for increased computational performance.” We have also added a comment to Section 2.5 regarding the Lennard–Jones interaction: “The attractive force has a short range, and is practically zero at h = 2θ.”
					0	(8)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	24	13	1	It would be interesting to explore the approach the reviewer suggested; we have not yet explored more coarse grained models.
					0	(9)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	26	15	1	Shepard et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	26	15	1	claim that the formation of the reticulate pattern occurs on a faster scale than cell growth and division, and so we did not consider this in our model.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	26	15	1	Including this might make the results more robust, however, and we added a comment to the discussion.
					0	(10)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	27	16	1	We had plans to include a quantitative comparison, however we were not able obtain a good dataset for doing so.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	27	16	1	It would be interesting to replicate Shepard’s experiments taking care to collect enough good quality images/movies for a quantitative analysis on the patterns.
					0	(11)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	Replicating Shepard and Sumner’s results was our primary objective for this paper, as we state in the discussion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	In future work we would like to increase the scale of the simulations by adding more trichomes and a deeper domain to (hopefully) get more robust reticulate formation.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	We would also like to do a quantitative analysis on experimental data to in order to fit the model to the data.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	Finally, we would like to see whether this same minimal system plus photomovement is sufficient to produce the cone-shaped structures documented by Walter, Petroff and others.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	If successful, we could then link macroscopic features of similar stromatolites back to the parameters of the trichomes, as well as understand the contribution of each factor in the model to building these structures.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	28	17	1	We have added this explanation to the conclusions section.
					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2: With the exception of their response to one key point, the authors' responses are satisfactory.
					0	Their suggested bending modulus value implies a very high persistence length of 0.5 metres.
					0	In their response, the authors mention that with the lower value from Boal and Ng the trichomes collapse into a heap, and so a larger bending modulus was necessary.
					0	They also argue that a very large persistence length implies that the cyanobacteria are stiff enough to largely be unaffected by thermal fluctuations.
					0	The paper can be published once the authors more clearly confront their disagreement with the results of Boal and Ng.
					0	In particular: (1)
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	At the end of the discussion of the bending modulus (in Section 2.8, on page 11), the implied persistence length and the irrelevance of thermal fluctuations should be explicitly mentioned.
					0	(2)
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	In Section 4, the discussion section of the paper, the topic of the bending modulus is returned to for a paragraph.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	This paragraph needs to explicitly address why the measurements of Boal and Ng were not used, i.e., why Boal and Ng misinterpreted their data.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	In particular the authors should suggest how the measurements are significant measurements to not use.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	In particular this paragraph needs to R8 suggest how the measurement should be done to properly test their suggested values for the bending modulus, and so resolve the disagreement with Boal and Ng.
					0	Round 2: Author Response to Reviewer 1 We have addressed the reviwer’s requests: (1)
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	We added the following sentence to the end of Section 2.8: “This value corresponds to a persistence length of 0.49 m, which implies that the trichomes would be practically unaffected by thermal fluctuations.”
					0	(2)
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	We added the following paragraph to the discussion: “Many of the model parameters, such as trichome length, diameter, gliding speed, reversal frequency, etc.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	are easily measured and are well known.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	However, the bending modulus is more difficult to measure directly.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	We attempted to use the bending modulus implied from the relation α= kBT ε and Boal and Ng’s (2010, p. 4625) measurements of the trichome persistence length, but the resulting value seemed too low compared to measurements of other bacteria and in practice the virtual trichomes appeared flaccid during simulations.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	It is possible that the flexure seen in Boal and Ng’s trichomes was due more to the motility of the trichomes than random thermal fluctuations, in which case the above relation would no longer be valid, and a more complex model would be required to associate the observed geometry of the trichomes to their bending modulus.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	For example, Wolgemuth (2005) used an elastic model to estimate the bending modulus of M. xanthus by fitting the model to the flailing motions of a Myxobacterium stuck at one end.”
