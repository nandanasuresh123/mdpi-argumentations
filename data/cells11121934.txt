Author Response In this manuscript, the authors proposed the texture analysis of the CC images taken by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).
Even though it might be the first try, unfortunately, in the technical point of view the manuscript is not completed.
It just presents the application of the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) software to the OCTA images.
We would like to clarify to the reviewer that SSADA is a vital component of OCTA software, as it decreases the signal to noise ratio of flow detection, enabling visualization of retinal vasculature.
Thus, it is an inherent component of OCTA software and not something we have done.
Our report is the use of computerized texture analysis on OCTA images of the choriocapillaris.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique based on the optical scattering properties of specimens.
To get the specific parameter from the OCT images of different specimens, the gray scale might be adjusted properly.
Therefore, it is recommended to add detail explanations about the image processing processes performed to calculate each texture feature.
In Appendix A, which was included with the original submission, readers are able to see how various texture features were calculated.
There is a line referring readers to this supplementary material in lines 104-105.
In section 2, it is recommended to present the en-face OCTA images obtained with the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) software.
Explanation is necessary on what this software is.
We included a figure of the en-face OCTA image at the level of the choriocapillaris in the original submission.
It is included in figure 1A.
Additionally, we have added a brief explanation of SSADA software in lines 78-79.
In section 3.1, it would be better to add reference(s) explaining the reason for selecting the parameters.
Explanation on the meaning of each texture feature is necessary.
These are mostly novel parameters that our group is reporting as it pertains to textural analysis of the choriocapillaris in particular.
We acknowledge in lines 229-231 that this is the first report of computerized texture analysis used to quantify patterns of the normal choriocapillaris in OCTA images.
Therefore, they will be not be extensively reported in similar studies of the choriocapillaris in the literature.
However, in lines 180-186 of the original work, we discuss prior instances where entropy, energy, and contrast parameters have been reported.
We further discuss a similar previous study by Montesano et al.
to provide context regarding the parameters we have chosen and their implications for texture analysis of the choriocapillaris.
Furthermore, we would direct the reviewer to descriptions of these texture parameters and how they were calculated that were included in the original submission on lines 87-94, as well as on the supplementary file included.
With Figure 3 and 4, the authors conclude that the texture analysis through OCTA gives coherent and consistent results.
However, without any control group, it is not easy to get the conclusion.
The multiple measurements with a same specimen will give well coherent and consistent results.
Similarly, the measurements with a same group will do the same.
We must emphasize that this study is a proof-of-concept demonstrating a novel application of textural analysis of the choriocapillaris layer.
We do not intend for there to be a control group due to this point nor should one be expected in a proof-of-concept study design.
The conclusion that we have derived coherent and consistent results in our initial patient population is an important one in this proof-of-concept image analysis study.
we respectfully disagree with the notion that measurements from the same group will always be coherent and consistent, since this should not be expected to be the case.
We have observed tight clustering of textural parameters, supporting the conclusion that texture analysis of the choriocapillaris is feasible and can be extended into different patient populations as next steps for application.
If we observed, instead, that there was a great deal of variation in healthy eyes, it would preclude us from extending our work to study eyes with disordered choroids/choriocapillaris.
Our results and conclusion are important in light of this.
Author Response The Comments were addressed sufficiently.
However, it is worthy to cite some of the papers, which address about the feature characterization using OCT. Ex: Biophotonic approach for the characterization of initial bitter-rot progression on apple specimens using optical coherence tomography assessments.
Thank you for your suggestion.
We have added four papers, including the one suggested, displaying the use of OCT and OCTA for feature characterization in diverse fields in both biology and medicine.
We hope that these will further anchor our manuscript in the current literature and further demonstrate the feasibility of our work.
