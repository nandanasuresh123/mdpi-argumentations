Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	Thanks for the commerts.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	To the best of our knowledge, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet is still the main material used for magneto-optical devices.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	They include bismuth doped YIG, bismuth, terbium doped YIG and cerium doped YIG.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Other materials such as Wely semimatels are still under theoretical study[1].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We have added comments to these materials in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Revisions: Page 1, line 21, added “At present, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet (RIG) is the most widely used magneto-optical material in integrated MO devices.” Point 2:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	How will the temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation hysteresis loops of Dy:CeYIG thin films change when moving to another wavelength range?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Is there any dependence on the wavelength?
					0	Response 2: Thanks for the commerts.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Absoultly there is also temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation when shift to other wavelengths.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	However, the transparency window of this material is in the 1550 nm wavelength range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	When moving to shorter wavelengths, the absorption of this material increases sharply, making them less practical for photonic device applications.
					0	Point 3:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	How can one explain the increase in the value of the Faraday rotation angle in the range of 30-40 degrees for Dy:CeYIG (Fig. 3f), which is absent for Ce:YIG (Fig. 3f)?
					0	Response 3: Thanks for the commerts.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	The saturation magnetization of rare-earth doped YIG affects the Faraday rotation angle.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	Sayetat et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	and Ostorero et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	previously reported that the compensation temperature of DyIG is Tcomp = 225 K [2,3], which could decrease the Faraday rotation angle of Dy:CeIG in this work at the temperature below 300 K. Therefore, a higher Faraday rotation may be related to the increase of the saturation magnetization of this material in this temperature range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Revisions:Page 5, line 170-173, added “The increase of the Faraday rotation below 40 ℃ is possibly due to the increase of the magnetization of this material at this temperature range, considering a compensation temperature of 225 K in Dy3Fe5O12 [19,20].”.
