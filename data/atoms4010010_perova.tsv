					0	This research field, concerning the three-body dynamics, is known to be a well-studied area.
					0	The main point in this work is to theoretically study relativistic ionization.
					0	However,
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	the authors did not show further supports to their calculations, namely, by comparing the present calculations with experiments or other theoretical method (from other groups).
					0	The following issues need to be addressed: ------------------------------- Answer of authors ------------------------------- First of all, we would like to thank you very much because you have seen at first glance the importance of this work using QED formalism.
					0	1) Earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], a fully relativistic distorted-wave Born approximation (rDWBA) has been developed to describe the relativistic ionization processes.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors did not mention this method for discussions in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The RPWBA method in the manuscript should be compared with the previous rDWBA theory.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	At least the authors should mention the differences of the two methods and how far the RPWBA can be compared to rDWBA?
					0	------------------------------- 1) Answer of authors -------------------------------
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The review article by W Nakel and C. T. Whelan you refer to do indeed tackle the relativistic regime but at the expense of a huge amount of numerical work.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	So, we think that presenting for the first time a work that incorporates fully analytical results and QED formalism is interesting to the scientific community.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The work of W Nakel and C. T. Whelan is devoted to study heavy atoms but Our work is aimed to study analytically the hydrogen atom, we believe that such a comparison is impossible.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	Another difference that makes comparison difficult is that the work of W Nakel and C. T. Whelan uses coplanar asymmetric geometry while in our work we use coplanar symmetric geometry.
					0	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Again in earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], there are existing experiments of triple differential cross sections for relativistic K-shell ionization of Ag, Au, and so on.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The authors did not mention these experimental works in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	It would be nice if the RPWBA method in the manuscript can be compared with the experiments.
					0	------------------------------- 2) Answer of authors -------------------------------
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	3	1	We are fully aware that the mainstream trend is to study heavy atoms.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	3	1	But some fundamental processes have not until now been investigated fully and analytically and it is our very humble belief that such a fundamental work must be presented to the international scientific community.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	3	1	We are not in a position to compare with these works since they are devoted to heavy atoms.
					0	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors have not carefully proofread this manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Evidences of this includes (i) some errors in English typing, e.g.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	line 27 and line 119: it should be ‘plane wave …’ instead of ‘plan wave …’.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Line between 33 and 34: it should be ‘The scattered positron and ejected electron …’ instead of ‘The scattered electron and ejected positron …’.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	(ii) There are repeated Bibliography like ref.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	11 and ref.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	31.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	4	1	Points (i) and (ii) have been corrected and changed following to the referee’s amendments.
					0	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We hope that we have given convincing answers to your remarks as they were very sound and relevant.

					0	Author Response %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Answer to the second referee’s report of the Manuscript ID atoms-114670 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% This manuscript reports new TDCS calculations for relativistic positron and electron impact on atomic hydrogen.
					0	Although no experimental data are available for comparison, the method is well explained and reported to agree with other electron impact calculations.
					0	In my opinion, the primary contribution of this work is the prediction that even at relativistic velocities, the TDCS for positron impact is larger than for electron impact and that the difference increases with impact energy.
					0	In spite of the lack of any experimental, or, as is claimed, any theoretical, verification of this or any physical interpretation as to why this should occur even at very high velocities, I believe that work deserves publication since it should incite additional theoretical attempts to verify these predictions.
					0	Also, hopefully sometime in the future, TDCS studies for positron impact will advance to the stage where the present predictions can be tested.
					0	I find no major problems with the manuscript, either in content or presentation.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	As for minor problems, there are numerous English grammatical errors which I have attempted to list in order to facilitate publication.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	In addition, I do believe that several figures could be combined in order to minimize journal space.
					0	These are listed below.
					0	My overall recommendation is that after the listed items are addressed the manuscript be accepted for publication without further review.

					0	· Title: atoms, not atom · Line 3: states is misspelled.

					0	· Line 92: delete “a” · Line 93: insert “the” before “non-“ · Line 97: insert “the” before “non” and “ejected” · Line 98: insert “the” before “residual” · Line 102: insert “a” before “plane” · Line 103: function (singular) · Lines 99 and 104 and Table I: again, check with journal whether a comma or period should be used in the numbers · Captions for figures 1 and 2: insert “are” before “geometric” also check whether commas or periods should be used in the numbers · Line 106 and figures 3 and 4: giving the energies in keV and rounding to the keV value is preferable.
					0	Also, the shift in angle would be more apparent to the reader if identical angular scales were used.
					0	Plus, I recommend combining the two figures and using some sort of velocity scaling on the vertical axis to illustrate the falloff in magnitude.
					0	· Line 108: don’t capitalize “triple” · Line 112 and caption for Table I: insert “the” before “TDCS: and “peaks” and change “peak’s” to “peak” without italics · Line 115: delete “for positron impact” at end of sentence.

					0	· Line 129: insert “the” before “TDCS” · Table 2: number notation · Line 134: replace “by” with “with” · Lines 135-137: delete this sentence as it says exactly the same as the previous sentence and Table 2.
					0	· Line 138: insert “the” before “TDCS” also inserting “even at relativistic energies” would strengthen this intent of this work · Line 139: reference 30 should be replaced with a theoretical reference or the text changed to not imply that ref 30 is a theoretical work · Line 140: delete “one” and insert “the” before “non” plus change “that this would enhance” to “this enhances” Also lines 141-143 are probably meant to be a single sentence.
					0	Please correct.
					0	· Line 143: change “The” to “This” · Line 144: change “should be” to “is” · Line 148: insert “the” before “attractive” · Line 149: capitalize “on” · Paragraph 138-153: Arguments for why the positron cross section is larger at low energies are given but no discussion as to if they would, or would not, apply at high energies is given.
					0	It could be argued that in very fast collisions the electron cloud has no time to respond so some other explanation is needed.
					0	Please add additional comments.
					0	· Line 155: change “impact of positron has” to “positron impact have” · Line 157: insert “the” before “first” · Line 160: delete “of the electron” and insert “and electron” before “impact” · Line 162: replace “these of the” with “for”
