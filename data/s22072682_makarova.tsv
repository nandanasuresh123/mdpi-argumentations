					0	"Dear Authors: I appreciate the possibility to review the paper entitled ""Exploration of an inflection point of ventilation parameters with anaerobic threshold using strucchange"" by the authors Aida et al."
					0	In this paper, using a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer, it is proposed to determine the anaerobic threshold using the strucchange analysis of the time series and compare it with the V slope method and the respiratory and metabolic indexes proposed by Wasserman.
					0	In this respect, I find the work interesting, well-structured, and with promising results.
					0	However, I would like to make a few comments.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The methods do not specify how the baseline load of the participants was determined.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	In figure 3, the indication of the test time appears in the reverse direction.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	I recommend deleting graphs 5, 8, and 11 because graphs 7, 10, and 13 show the same information together with lines obtained by analyzing the structural change of the time series.
