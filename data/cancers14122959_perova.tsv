					0	Cancers-1602413, Tumor Treating Fields Concomitant with Sorafenib Inhibit Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Vitro and in Vivo.
					0	In this manuscript, the authors, Davidi et al have investigated the effect of TTFields in HCC cells and an animal model, alone or in combination with sorafenib.
					0	Overall, the authors believe that this research demonstrates potential for concomitant TTFields and sorafenib application in the treatment of HCC.
					0	I read the manuscript with interest and commend the authors for the work done in the area of liver cancer treatment.
					0	However, I feel that the experiments around this concept were not designed well enough to support their new findings.
					0	I have raised the following concerns which is necessary to make this manuscript more scientifically interesting.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	What is the rationale of using 150 kHz TTFields?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	TTFields at 100 kHz has also shown significant differences as cytotoxicity at p<0.01 and p<0.001 in HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cells which have around 60% and 50% of cell survival.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Why did the authors use high frequency of TTFields though the cytotoxicity was also observed in lower dose (Fig 1A).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	What is the ‘n’ number of the samples and experiments in each group?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Also mention the ‘n’ number in all the experiments involved for invitro and invivo.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	LC3 is increased in all the groups except in control tissue, however, cell death was increased only in combined group.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	How can the authors correlate autophagy with apoptosis?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	It is not so trustworthy that the only expression of LC3B indicate the treated condition have increased autophagy in the tumor tissue.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Other important autophagy and degradation markers like Beclin1 and P62 need to be shown to reflect the regulatory mechanism of TTFields, as well as for the combined treatment with Sorafenib.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	What was the total weight of livers in all groups?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Please update the images of whole liver showing tumors on it, or at least pictures of tumors which were removed after sacrifice, if applicable.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Several data have shown very high error bars in each group (especially Fig Can the author provide the tumor images which were harvested from mice?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	In the IHC experiment for PARP, the authors have incubated with primary antibody only for 30 min?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	Is that timing enough to get protein expression?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	What source of secondary antibody was used?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	In addition to IHC, I suggest performing western blot using PARP antibody where the full length and cleaved bands are observed in the same blot.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	The figure number is mislabeled in Fig 4D-LC3 Immunofluorescence.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Why there is no error bar in the control group of all bar graphs?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Please include error bars and re-calculate the statistical analysis for all the data wherever missing.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Figure legends of Fig2D is missing.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Fig C is repeated in the legend.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Please label the figures appropriately.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	It is so frustrating to understand.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	There is no data in Fig 4A.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Whole data is missing but have explained in the result section and in figure legends.??
Reviewer_1	Author	1	11	0	2	Line 337 seems over statement since the data are not shown in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	Typos: Line 111, ‘invitro’ spelling is not correct.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	Double ‘and’ in Line 342.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	Need language and grammar check.
					0	This study identified the efficacy of TTFields treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and the combined effect of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo.
					0	The authors suggested that the therapeutic effects of the combination were apoptosis via autophagy.
					0	This is an interesting scientific study, as it concerns the issue of hepatocellular carcinoma, it also has a clinical aspect.
					0	The authors indicated that TTField had potential to be a new treatment option of hepatocellular carcinoma.
					0	The materials and methods section are elaborated in the details.
					0	The present study was examined in terms of autophagy and apoptosis in the antitumor effects of TTField and sorafenib.
					0	However, the exact mechanism of the combination therapy-induced cell death is not yet known as the activation of autophagy in the combination therapy was not increased.
					0	Therefore, I expect further additional examination in the future.
					0	References contain mostly publications printed in the last 10 years.
					0	The manuscript is an interesting work related to a potential new therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using TTFields in combination with a TKI (Sorafenib).
					0	However,
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	the limited experimental design and paucity of strong data ask for more experiments to proof the feasibility of this combination for treating HCC
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	In vitro experiments sub-section in Methods sections lacks many experimental details (e.g., type of plate/flask, plating overnight or not before experiment, number of plated cells).
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	A very important missing is not showing the actual number of rats included in the final analyses (the ones who successfully received therapy for more than 18 hours/day).
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	This must be added.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	What is puzzling in this investigation is showing functional data using two human cell lines and in vivo data using rat cells.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	While I do not know if the authors have the technology to perform TTFileds in mice, where for sure they should have done xenograft models with the two human cell lines, why the rat cell line was not studied in vitro using the same experimental strategies as for human cells.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	This must be done and included for a better understanding of TTFieldds activity from in vitro to in vivo data.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	What are the p53 status and the apoptosis signaling pathway function in N1S1 cells?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Maybe the cytotoxicity data will reveal a different better frequency.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Another puzzling experiment is the schedule for the in vivo work.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Since the authors missed to add Figure 4A for timeline, based on Methods section the rats were treated for 5 days with TTFields and or sorafenib and a day later the rays were sacrificed.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	While a short “acute” follow-up is welcome the most important experiment should allow the follow-up for much more days to indeed observe the effect of TTFields added to sorafenib.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	I could not find an explanation for not including a long term follow-up.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	In my opinion, this is a key therapeutically experiment which must be done and included in the study.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	There is no explanation why the most effective dose was 150 kHz and higher does actually decreases the killing.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Can this dose observed in vitro on only tumor cells be translated to in vivo work where the tumor microenvironment is total different?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	Why the in vitro experiment was performed for 72 hours and in in vivo for 120 hours?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	Any explanation for why not using cloroquine in vivo to integrate better the in vitro data.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	The authors claim that cytotoxicity was measured “by cell counting using iCyt EC800 (Sony Biotechnology) 123 flow cytometer, and expressed as a percentage relative to the control.” Does this imply that they counted the live cells and plotted the final data as percentage of untreated controls (as figure 1 suggests).
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	However, is this a real cytotoxicity or a cell growth inhibition?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	Did they measure the adherent cells after trypsinization.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	Were the cells from supernatant counted (where are probably the majority of dead cells)?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	There is a big difference between a therapy which kills vs a therapy which induces a cellular arrest.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	Since sorafenib acts also on angiogenesis, did the authors investigate if TTFields may interfere with anti-angiogenic effect sorafenib-mediated?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	Also, is there any evidence that TTF may prevent the pretty common resistance to sorafenib observed in clinic?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	Moreover, there is a discrepancy between the fold changes in tumor weight vs. volume in the combination group vs. untreated group.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	Did the authors check changes in blood vessels density.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	Were the mice perfused before collecting the tumors?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	10	0	2	Was Mycoplasma testing done routinely?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	10	0	2	Were the cells checked also for authenticity?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	11	0	2	Is there any explanation why the combination of TTFields and sorafenib did not induce a significant level of autophagy as compared to untreated animals which invalid the initial hypothesis that “concomitant application of sorafenib and TTFields may increase stress levels enough to tilt autophagy towards the cell death pathway”.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	12	0	2	The statement “TTFields concomitant with sorafenib induced a significant increase in apoptosis’ in the abstract section is overstated.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	12	0	2	When compared with sorafenib alone there is practically no difference.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	12	0	2	Moreover, TTFields failed to increases apoptosis when added to sorafenib and compared to sorafenib alone in one out of two human cells line investigated
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	Finally, adding to all the above questions, I found a very weak Discussion section which must be extended.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	Moreover, in the Discussion section, the authors concluded that “TTFields display efficacy for treatment of HCC in vitro and in vivo, with an optimal frequency of 150 kHz”.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	This is not a correct statement.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	While for in vitro data, the authors have data, for in vivo they used only one frequency of 150 Hz.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	At least one different dose should have been studied for comparison since this is a completely different tumor environment than the in vitro one.
					0	In general, the manuscript is well written and provides novel and interesting data illustrating the possibility to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
					0	This might be achieved by using the combination of so-called Tumor Treating fields (TTFields) with targeted drug, I have the following suggestions about this manuscript:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	1) The authors demonstrate the efficacy of TTFields in vivo even when used as monotherapy.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	As shown in the Figure 4 C and D, TTFields were found less effective in terms of reducing the tumors volume and weight when compared with sorafenib.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	However, no differences in expression of LC3 marker were observed between these groups (treated with TTFields or with sorafenib)(as shown in Figure 4D).
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	Similarly, low evidence of apoptosis (expression of cleaved PARP) was found in these groups, as shown in Figure 4F.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	What is the mechanism illustrating higher efficiency of sorafenib against HCC?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	2	0	2	2) Despite the expression of cleaved PARP was very low in the tumors treated with TTFields or sorafenib alone ( as shown in IHC-images in Figure 4F), the authors declare about ~ 20% of positive cells, as show in the graphs below IHC-staining.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	2	0	2	Similar, the graphs illustrating the LC3 expression are not in a proper fit with the images shown in Figure 4D.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	3	0	2	3) It will be much better to provide the data to explain the mechanisms illustrating why the monotherapy of TTFields or sorafenin induced autophagy, whereas the tumors treated with combination developed the substantial apoptotic death of tumor cells.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	4	0	2	4) Since Annexin V/7-ADD data was not convincing and the authors observed the minor increase of apoptotic cells after HCC cells were treated with combination of TTFields and sorafenib ( when compared to the cells treated with TTFiealds and sorafenib alone), I suggest to run the WBs to examine the expression of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3 ( for both HCC cell lines).
Reviewer_4	Author	1	4	0	2	This might be helpful and make the in vitro data more relavant with the data shown in vivo.
					0	Minor:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	5	0	2	1) Figure 4A is missing.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	6	0	2	2) the different HCC cell lines were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments, therfore making difficult to compare these data.
					0	I thank the authors for their extensive work and comprehensive review of the manuscript.
					0	The revised manuscript is trying to be responsive to previous review comments.
					0	However, the new information added, instead to shed light, it brings more confusion.
					0	Overall the author’s main conclusion in the abstract is overstated and is not supported by many questionable data and experimental design.
					0	As I see the results in the actual setting, adding TTFields treatment demonstrated a toxic effect when added to sorafenib.
					0	While I totally understand that the main reason for sacrificing the rats one day after last TTF, as authors mentioned in the letter “it was non-ethical to continue the study further”, this should have applied only for the rats belonging to control group.
					0	Majority of rodent study in cancer research lose the control group early but the treated groups are followed up for much longer to delineate indeed the efficacy vs. toxicity.
					0	It is practically impossible to appreciate a therapeutic effect in such a short time and upon monitoring effect for 1 day.
					0	Kaplan-Meyer survival curves are mandatory when toxic treatments are combined and compared.
					0	Is this indeed an anti-tumor effect or a very toxic effect to the liver (including tumor).
					0	Were there any investigation performed in animals to demonstrate a local/systemic toxicity?
					0	Were normal liver areas investigated?
					0	Were the IHC slides blinded to the pathologist(s)?
					0	The in vivo model appears to be performed only time which question the validity of data.
					0	I am not sure why the randomization of rats was unequally, practically 50% in TTF groups vs. control and sorafenib alone.
					0	The rigor science recommends at least 2 independent experiments with at least 7 animals randomized per group.
					0	The new western blot data are puzzling me.
					0	First of all I do not understand why it is so much variability between GADPH signals in all blots in the paper, especially within the same experiment.
					0	The reference protein should have the same intensity since this is the control for equal protein loading.
					0	Moreover, many bands belonging to all investigated proteins are truncated, fractured and I identified a lot of troubleshooting in bands due the presence of bubbling when running the blots.
					0	When come to densitometry, and especially when we look at the small range of fold changes between groups and controls, these troubleshooting can make huge differences.
					0	As a rule of thumb, when a housekeeping protein gives problems in immunoblotting, there are many other classic protein to switch the investigation (b-actin, vinculin, Ku, etc.).
					0	Otherwise, all protein investigation appears as a consequence of random effect with some fishing expedition.
					0	Another weird observation is the new figures 3D, E, and F. Despite showing the same fold changes graphs in letter to reviewer and updated manuscript, the bands are different and all over the place in the mentioned files.
					0	The bands for 48 hours figure 3D (right panel), 6 and 24 hours for figure 3E and 48 hours for figure F are completely different between the letter and mansucript.
					0	What is even more confusing is that in figure 4 for time points 6 and 24 hours, where, despite keeping the same GAPDH bands, the cleaved PARP data are changed.
					0	There is no way to analyze bands for a protein using the GAPDH data from another experiment.
					0	Which data should be believable?
					0	This way to present the data questions a lot the quality of experimental work and consequently and importantly the final analysis of data and the concluion claimed by the authors.
					0	Were these western blots (Figure 3D-F) repeated 3 times as the material and method mentions?
					0	As a final observation, the Conclusion section, the hallmark of any work, is weird and poorly written.
					0	It looks like a speculative discussion section with no clear point of view of the authors and general conclusions of their presented work.
					0	Response to Reviewer 1 Comments In this manuscript, the authors, Davidi et al have investigated the effect of TTFields in HCC cells and an animal model, alone or in combination with sorafenib.
					0	Overall, the authors believe that this research demonstrates potential for concomitant TTFields and sorafenib application in the treatment of HCC.
					0	I read the manuscript with interest and commend the authors for the work done in the area of liver cancer treatment.
					0	However, I feel that the experiments around this concept were not designed well enough to support their new findings.
					0	I have raised the following concerns which is necessary to make this manuscript more scientifically interesting.
					0	Point 1: What is the rationale of using 150 kHz TTFields?
					0	TTFields at 100 kHz has also shown significant differences as cytotoxicity at p<0.01 and p<0.001 in HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cells which have around 60% and 50% of cell survival.
					0	Why did the authors use high frequency of TTFields though the cytotoxicity was also observed in lower dose (Fig 1A).
					0	Response 1:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We thank the reviewer for this important question and would be happy to clarify.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	TTFields are alternating electric fields in the range of 100 to 500 kHz, with maximal efficacy seen at a different frequency for different tumor types.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Since TTFields cannot be applied at several different frequencies simultaneously, one specific frequency needs to be selected, and so the first step in examination of a new tumor type is a frequency scan.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The effect of TTFields is not dichotomic, such that only one frequency is effective while the other are not at all.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	From the frequencies showing efficacy the purpose is to select the most effective one.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	It should be clarified that higher frequencies of the alternating electric fields do not mean higher energy, and hence there is no disadvantage in working with higher frequencies and no added toxicity or increased side effects for higher frequencies within the TTFields frequency range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Of note, TTFields at 200 kHz is already approved and has been applied to more than 18,000 patients with glioblastoma, with skin irritation being the main treatment related adverse event.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	TTFields at 150 kHz is approved for treatment of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	To address these issues, we have rephrased the discussion: “It has been previously shown that maximal effectivity of TTFields occurs at a different frequency for different cancer types, owing to the specific electrical properties of the cells [15, 28].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Hence, the first step in applying TTFields to a new tumor type includes frequency scans.” and “The lower TTFields intensity required for treatment of HepG2 relative to Huh-7D12 cells for achieving the same level of efficacy suggest higher sensitivity of the former to TTFields.” Point 2: What is the ‘n’ number of the samples and experiments in each group?
					0	Also mention the ‘n’ number in all the experiments involved for invitro and invivo.
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We thank the reviewer for pointing this was not clear.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	As mentioned in the statistical analysis sub-section within the methods part, all in vitro experiments were repeated at least 3 times, and so depicted
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	values are mean (N ≥ 3) ± SEM.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We have now added this also to the legends of figures 1, 2, and 3.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Per the in vivo study, as was mentioned in the methods (sub-section 2.8), 52 animals were included in the study.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The specific numbers in each treatment group are now mentioned in the results (sub-section 3.4): “During the treatment period, average tumor volumes of control animals (n = 11) increased 5.9-fold (Figure 4b and 4c; and Figure S3 for tumor images).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	For animals treated with TTFields (n = 15) or sorafenib (n = 10), tumor growth was significantly lower, 3.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	In the TTFields-sorafenib combination group (n = 16), a 1.6-fold increase in tumor volume within the treatment period was observed, a growth significantly lower than that for control or for each treatment alone.” It is also mentioned in the legend of figure 4: “Rats (n = 52) were inoculated orthotopically with rat HCC N1S1 cells, and treated with sham-vehicle (n = 11), TTFields alone (n = 15), sorafenib alone (n = 10), or TTFields + sorafenib (n = 16), according to the depicted timeline (a).” Point 3: LC3 is increased in all the groups except in control tissue, however, cell death was increased only in combined group.
					0	How can the authors correlate autophagy with apoptosis?
					0	It is not so trustworthy that the only expression of LC3B indicate the treated condition have increased autophagy in the tumor tissue.
					0	Other important autophagy and degradation markers like Beclin1 and P62 need to be shown to reflect the regulatory mechanism of TTFields, as well as for the combined treatment with Sorafenib.
					0	Response 3:
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	We sincerely appreciate this well-taken comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	First, we would like to emphasize that indications of autophagy were diverse and determined from increased cellular granularity, amplified lipidation of LC3 (from LC3-I to LC3-II) detected by Western blot, and elevated levels of LC3 foci observed by fluorescent staining.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Nevertheless, to better explain the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis we have performed additional examinations to include more markers and additional time points.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	As per the reviewer’s request,
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	these examinations were performed for the combined treatment as compared to TTFields and sorafenib alone.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	We thank the reviewer for this comment, as these additions add much clarity to the mechanism of action of TTFields in combination with sorafenib and provide a more coherent explanation for the in vivo results.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	These additions may be seen in Figure 3 and are described in results sub-section 3.4, Autophagy-apoptosis Interplay For Treatment with Concomitant TTFields and Sorafenib: “In order to investigate the mechanism of action of TTFields-sorafenib co-application, HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with TTFields, sorafenib (3µM), or the two modalities together, and then examined for expression levels of various proteins.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	For HepG2 cells, the autophagy marker beclin-1 demonstrated elevation after 6 hours of treatment, which was later replaced with diminished expression levels (Figure 3d).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	This type of behavior was seen in all treatment groups, but was most pronounced for TTFields-sorafenib co-application.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	The autophagy marker LC3 also displayed such bi-phasic characteristics, but with a somewhat slower kinetics, showing some elevation at 6 hours of treatment, but higher elevation at the 24 hours time point (Figure 3d).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	As in the case of beclin-1, the magnitude of the effect was higher for co-treatment of TTFields and sorafenib relative to the monotherapies.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	GRP78, a marker of ER stress, remained low in all treatment groups for 6 and 24 hours of treatment, but demonstrated elevated levels at the later, 48-hours time point (Figure 3e).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	The apoptosis marker cleaved PARP displayed increased expression in the combined group already after 24 hours, elevating even further after 48 hours of treatment.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	For the monotherapies, cleaved PARP increase was only evident at 48 hours of treatment, and to a lower extent than that in the co-treatment group (Figure 3f).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	The slower kinetics of the autophagy-apoptosis path in the Huh-7D12 cells, as seen from the elevation of LC3 after as much as 48 hours (Figure 2c and d), prevented from detecting such changes in the levels of these markers in this cell line (Figure S1).” And in the discussion part “Kinetic examination in the HepG2 cells revealed elevation in autophagy levels as early as 6 hours of TTFields or sorafenib treatment, which diminished and were replaced with ER stress and apoptosis for 48 hours of treatment.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	These results are in line with a previous study that focused on the effects of sorafenib on such markers in HepG2 cells [32].
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	The higher changes in expression levels and faster kinetics when TTFields and sorafenib were applied together rather than alone indicate higher stress levels imposed on the cells in the former case.” Figure 3.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	HepG2 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with 150 kHz TTFields, 3 µM sorafenib, or the two treatments combined, followed by Western blot examination of the autophagy markers beclin-1 and LC3 (d), the ER stress marker GRP78 (e), and the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP (f).

Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	In the animal study we have now added IHC examination of beclin-1 and of GRP78, a marker for ER stress, as described in results sub-section 3.4.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	Concomitant TTFields with Sorafenib Enhances Treatment Efficacy in Vivo: “Tumor histology and immunostaining for beclin-1 and LC3, GRP78, and cleaved PARP were performed to examine autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis levels, respectively.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Beclin-1 levels were increased more than 4-fold relative to control in all treatment groups, while intensity of LC3 staining was increased about 3-fold relative to control in the individual TTFields and sorafenib groups, but elevated only 2-fold in the combination group (Figure 4e).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	GRP78 levels in the groups treated with TTFields or sorafenib alone remained unchanged from the control, but were elevated 2-fold in the TTFields plus sorafenib group (Figure 4f).
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	Additionally, the percentage of cells positive for cleaved PARP was significantly higher relative to control only in the combination group (Figure 4g).” and also in the discussion: “The lower autophagy accompanied by the higher ER stress and apoptosis displayed in the conjunction group relative to the monotherapies groups following 6 days of treatment suggest that these animals were pushed further along the autophagy-apoptosis kinetic timeline due to the higher levels of stress experienced by these animals, in accordance with the results described for the cell cultures.” Figure 4. tumor slices were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for beclin-1 and LC3 (e), GRP78 (f), and cleaved PARP (g).

					0	Response 4:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Per the reviewer’s request we show below images of the tumors within the liver, which we have also provided now in the supporting material of the paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	As may be seen, the liver itself is much larger than the tumor, and so we did not see value in measuring total liver weight, and hence cannot provide these values.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	While we tried to reduce variability between the animals by excluding those that at treatment initiation had tumor volumes not within the range 30–100 mm3, there was still divergence between the animals that resulted in the standard deviation bars depicted in the figure.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	It is however important to mention that there was a very good correlation between tumor volume (as measured by MRI) versus tumor weight at the end of the study, as may be seen in the graph below.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Figure S3.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Images of tumors within the livers of the rats treated with sham heat (control rats), TTFields, sorafenib, or TTFields plus sorafenib.
					0	Point 5: In the IHC experiment for PARP, the authors have incubated with primary antibody only for 30 min?
					0	Is that timing enough to get protein expression?
					0	What source of secondary antibody was used?
					0	In addition to IHC, I suggest performing western blot using PARP antibody where the full length and cleaved bands are observed in the same blot.
					0	Response 5:
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	6	1	IHC tests the presence of a protein already expressed in the tissue, and 30 min are sufficient to allow recognition and binding of the antibody to the target protein.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	6	1	The secondary antibody is an HRP conjugated goat anti rabbit, that is a part of the Leica HRP-refine detection kit (Cat # DS9800).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	6	1	We have added the missing antibody information to section 2.10.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	6	1	We unfortunately do not have any tissue left to allow for performing WB analysis from the in vivo study, but we have conducted additional cell line studies and added WB analysis of cleaved PARP for the in vitro examinations and additional IHC examinations for autophagy and ER stress markers (as shown in response 3).
					0	Point 6: The figure number is mislabeled in Fig 4D-LC3 Immunofluorescence.
					0	Response 6:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	7	1	We thank the reviewer for identifying this mistake, and have corrected this, changing the label of the LC3 data to e.
					0	 Point 7: Why there is no error bar in the control group of all bar graphs?
					0	Please include error bars and re-calculate the statistical analysis for all the data wherever missing.
					0	Response 7:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	We appreciate this question.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	8	1	Error bars are not missing for the control groups, rather they are null, as the values displayed in these figures are relative to control, and so per definition all control experiments have the exact same value of 100 or 1 (for percentage or fold change, respectively).
					0	Point 8: Figure legends of Fig2D is missing.
					0	Fig C is repeated in the legend.
					0	Please label the figures appropriately.
					0	It is so frustrating to understand.
					0	Response 8:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	9	1	We apologize for this mistake, and have now corrected the figure legend.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	9	1	The quantification of immunofluorescence of LC3 foci formation is c, and immunoblotting showing LC3-II to LC3-I ratio is d. Point 9: There is no data in Fig 4A.
					0	Whole data is missing but have explained in the result section and in figure legends.
					0	Response 9:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	10	1	We apologize for accidently omitting Fig 4A.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	10	1	This figure depicts the timeline of the in vivo experiment for easier understanding of the study designed.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	10	1	We have now corrected this.
					0	Point 10: Line 337 seems over statement since the data are not shown in the manuscript.
					0	Response 10:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	11	1	We understand from the reviewer’s comments that the sentence “The higher effects seen in the presence of CQ reveal that the observed phenomenon is due to increased autophagic flux, rather than decreased autolysosome degradation” is not clear enough.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	11	1	We have hence rephrased the sentence to be more accurate and better deliver the message: “CQ is an inhibitor of lysosome degradation, commonly used to decipher whether the elevation of LC3 is due to upregulation of the autophagy process or reduced autophagosome turnover [30].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	11	1	The higher TTFields-induced elevation of LC3 seen in the presence of CQ suggest that the observed phenomenon is due to increased autophagic flux, rather than decreased autolysosome degradation.” Point 11: Typos: Line 111, ‘invitro’ spelling is not correct.
					0	Double ‘and’ in Line 342.
					0	Need language and grammar check.
					0	Response 11:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	12	1	The “inovitro” in line 111 is not a typo, it is the name of the system used for applying TTFields in vitro.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	12	1	In line 342 we removed the duplicate “and”, and thank the reviewer for catching this typo.
					0	Response to Reviewer 2 Comments This study identified the efficacy of TTFields treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and the combined effect of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo.
					0	The authors suggested that the therapeutic effects of the combination were apoptosis via autophagy.
					0	This is an interesting scientific study, as it concerns the issue of hepatocellular carcinoma, it also has a clinical aspect.
					0	The authors indicated that TTFields had potential to be a new treatment option of hepatocellular carcinoma.
					0	The materials and methods section are elaborated in the details.
					0	The present study was examined in terms of autophagy and apoptosis in the antitumor effects of TTFields and sorafenib.
					0	However, the exact mechanism of the combination therapy induced cell death is not yet known as the activation of autophagy in the combination therapy was not increased.
					0	Therefore, I expect further additional examination in the future.
					0	References contain mostly publications printed in the last 10 years.
					0	Response: We thank the reviewer for the positive review.
					0	Response to Reviewer 3 Comments The manuscript is an interesting work related to a potential new therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using TTFields in combination with a TKI (Sorafenib).
					0	However, the limited experimental design and paucity of strong data ask for more experiments to proof the feasibility of this combination for treating HCC.
					0	Point 1: In vitro experiments sub-section in Methods sections lacks many experimental details (e.g., type of plate/flask, plating overnight or not before experiment, number of plated cells).
					0	A very important missing is not showing the actual number of rats included in the final analyses (the ones who successfully received therapy for more than 18 hours/day).
					0	This must be added.
					0	Response 1:
Author	Reviewer_4	2	29	6	1	We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	2	1	For the in vitro experiments with TTFields (sub-section 2.3) we tried not to elaborate too much and referenced previous work describing all details.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	2	1	We understand that we have cut off too many details, and are happy to add them “HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cell suspensions (500 µl, 25 x 103 cells/plate) were placed as a drop in the center of 35-mm inovitro™ dishes composed of high dielectric constant ceramic (lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate [PMN-PT]), with two perpendicularly pairs of transducer arrays printed on their outer walls.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	2	1	Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow attachment to the dish, and then 2 ml of fresh media were added.” Regarding the number of rats included in the final analysis, we apologize this information was not clear.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	2	1	The 52 rats mentioned in the text were in fact the actual final number of animals in the analysis, since “all rats reached the required usage limit of ≥18 h/day”, as is now explicitly stated in the results sub-section 3.4.” Point 2: What is puzzling in this investigation is showing functional data using two human cell lines and in vivo data using rat cells.
					0	While I do not know if the authors have the technology to perform TTFields in mice, where for sure they should have done xenograft models with the two human cell lines, why the rat cell line was not studied in vitro using the same experimental strategies as for human cells.
					0	This must be done and included for a better understanding of TTFields activity from in vitro to in vivo data.
					0	What are the p53 status and the apoptosis signaling pathway function in N1S1 cells?
					0	Maybe the cytotoxicity data will reveal a different better frequency.
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	Using a xerograph model is indeed a good suggestion, however it would require working in immunosuppressed mice.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	It is currently not feasible for us to perform studies in which we apply TTFields to immunosuppressed animals, as these animals are of smaller weight thus the burden of wearing the electrodes may induce too much stress.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	Furthermore, these animals are more prone to contract infections during the process of electrodes placement and replacement on the animals.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	On the other hand, using the rat cells for in vitro experiments in the inovitro dishes turned out to be very technically challenging, as the cells were non-adherent, and so we could not pursue this important avenue.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that there is a possibility that the optimal frequency may differ in the N1S1 relative to the human cell lines.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	Therefore, we have addressed this issue by including results of an additional frequency scan experiments done with N1S1 cells.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	We now mention this in the text, results sub-section 3.4: “The efficacy of combining TTFields with sorafenib relative to each modality alone was examined in the N1S1 HCC rat orthotopic model (timeline in Figure 4a).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	In vitro experiments confirmed that the 150 kHz TTFields frequency found optimal for treatment of the human cell lines was also optimal for treatment of the murine N1S1 cells used for the in vivo study (Figure S2).” We provide the relevant frequency scan figure in the supplementary material.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	Per the good question by the reviewer regarding the p53 status of the N1S1 cells we added: “It is also worth mentioning that the N1S1 murine cells used for this study, like the HepG2 cells, are p53 wild type.” Figure S2.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	TTFields frequency scan in rat N1S1 HCC cells.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	N1S1 cells were treated with TTFields (1.7 V/cm RMS) across a frequency range of 100–400 kHz, and cell count were determined following 24 hours of treatment.
					0	Values are mean (N ≥ 3) ± SEM.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	*p < 0.05 relative to control; one-way ANOVA.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	3	1	ANOVA = analysis of variance; HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma; RMS = root mean square; SEM = standard error of the mean; TTFields = Tumor Treating Fields.
					0	Point 3: Another puzzling experiment is the schedule for the in vivo work.
					0	Since the authors missed to add Figure 4A for timeline, based on Methods section the rats were treated for 5 days with TTFields and or sorafenib and a day later the rats were sacrificed.
					0	While a short “acute” follow-up is welcome the most important experiment should allow the follow-up for much more days to indeed observe the effect of TTFields added to sorafenib.
					0	I could not find an explanation for not including a long term follow-up.
					0	In my opinion, this is a key therapeutically experiment which must be done and included in the study.
					0	Response 3:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	We thank the reviewer for this comment, and apologize that the illustration of the timeline was accidentally missing from the submission (we have now added it).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	The limiting factor for study duration was the well being of the animals.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	The tumors in the control group were very large, causing stress and weight loss of the animals.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	The arrays placed on the animals, together with the individual housing needed to prevent wire entanglement, adds even more stress and increases animal weight loss.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	Overall, it was non-ethical to continue the study further.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	We have now added this explanation to the discussion section to clarify this limitation of the study: “In the HCC animal model, the acute effects of TTFields and sorafenib were examined.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	4	1	Due to the large tumors developed in the control group and the stress experienced by the animals as a result of the individual housing and motility limitations imposed by the sham and TTFields arrays, longer treatment durations were not feasible.” Point 4: There is no explanation why the most effective dose was 150 kHz and higher does actually decreases the killing.
					0	Can this dose observed in vitro on only tumor cells be translated to in vivo work where the tumor microenvironment is totally different?
					0	Response 4: We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	It is important to understand that the TTFields frequency is not the treatment dose, and hence increased frequency does not mean increased efficacy.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	In the case of TTFields, intensity, duration, and usage are the factors that contribute to the “treatment dose”.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	Nevertheless, we have added to the discussion an explanation on this issue of optimal frequency: “It has been previously shown that maximal effectivity of TTFields occurs at a different frequency for different cancer types, owing to the specific electrical properties of the cells [15, 28].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	Hence, the first step in applying TTFields to a new tumor type includes frequency scans.” Regarding the option that the optimal frequency will differ between in vitro and in vivo setting, this is indeed a concern.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	However, as shown by the in vitro frequency scans, the effect of TTFields is not dichotomic, and effectiveness can be seen at more than one frequency.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	Therefore, the relatively low expected differences between animals treated with different TTFields frequencies together with the variability inherent to animal studies, makes it technically problematic to perform frequency scans in vivo.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	As of today, in vitro frequency scans are the common practice for determining the optimal TTFields frequency for delivery to animals and to humans.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	In fact, in vitro frequency scans were the basis for the clinical studies leading to FDA approval of TTFields at 200 kHz for the treatment of GBM and at 150 kHz for the treatment of MPM.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	5	1	We have added this issue to the discussion as a limitation of the study: “Since the optimal TTFields frequency has been shown to be dependent on the electrical properties of the cells and it is not clear how much effect the tumor microenvironment has on these properties, and because it is technically problematic to perform TTFields frequency scans in vivo, the frequency detected in the cell cultures was also employed for the animal studies.” Point 5: Why the in vitro experiment was performed for 72 hours and in in vivo for 120 hours?
					0	Response 5: We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	When it comes to testing efficacy, we would like to use a treatment duration as long as possible to maximize the effect.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	However, this duration varies between in vitro and in vivo work.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	For cell cultures, the control samples continue to grow throughout the treatment duration, and so after 72 h the plates are very much confluent, and may not be left to continue and grow any further (without drastic changes in the environmental conditions, making them inadequate control cells).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	It is also noteworthy that such treatment periods for in vitro work are well accepted in the field of TTFields research.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	In vivo, prior studies also used similar time frames of 2 to 3 weeks from inoculation when working with the N1S1 model (Buijs et al., 2012 -; Ju et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2012).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	16	6	1	Extending treatment duration was also limited by the physical status of the animals, as was explained in response 3.
					0	Point 6: Any explanation for why not using cloroquine in vivo to integrate better the in vitro data.
					0	Response 6: We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	7	1	Chloroquine was added to the cell cultures only at the final hours of the treatment for answering questions related to the mechanism of action, and not for boosting the efficacy of the other treatments.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	7	1	When using chloroquine in animal studies, it is for efficacy purposes, and so it is used throughout the treatment period.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	7	1	Since our animal experiment aimed to examine the efficacy of concomitant TTFields and sorafenib, with no additional agents, chloroquine was not employed.
					0	Point 7: The authors claim that cytotoxicity was measured “by cell counting using iCyt EC800 (Sony Biotechnology) 123 flow cytometer, and expressed as a percentage relative to the control.” Does this imply that they counted the live cells and plotted the final data as percentage of untreated controls (as figure 1 suggests).
					0	However, is this a real cytotoxicity or a cell growth inhibition?
					0	Did they measure the adherent cells after trypsinization.
					0	Were the cells from supernatant counted (where are probably the majority of dead cells)?
					0	There is a big difference between a therapy which kills vs a therapy which induces a cellular arrest.
					0	Response 7: We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	For the cytotoxicity assay we remove the supernatant, washed the cells, and then collect the adherent cells following trypsinization and visual inspection to verify all cells were removed.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	Indeed, as the reviewer mentioned correctly, we “counted the live cells and plotted the final data as percentage of untreated controls”.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	We agree that this is not cytotoxicity per se, and that is why we also perform 7-AAD/annexin-V staining of the cells.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	For this apoptosis assay we do collect the supernatant together with the adherent cells.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	Increased apoptosis and/or necrosis indicates that reduction in the cell number observed in the cell count emanates at least in part from cytotoxicity.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	8	1	We agree with the reviewer that we should not confuse the cell count measurements with the term “cytotoxicity” prior to showing the effect on apoptosis, and therefore we have changed this terminology throughout the paper.
					0	Point 8: Since sorafenib acts also on angiogenesis, did the authors investigate if TTFields may interfere with anti-angiogenic effect sorafenib-mediated?
					0	Also, is there any evidence that TTF may prevent the pretty common resistance to sorafenib observed in clinic?
					0	Moreover, there is a discrepancy between the fold changes in tumor weight vs. volume in the combination group vs. untreated group.
					0	Did the authors check changes in blood vessels density.
					0	Were the mice perfused before collecting the tumors?
					0	Response 8:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	We thank the reviewer for these questions.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	Preliminary tests using CD31 staining revealed no differences between the groups regarding blood vessel density and therefore we did not pursue the research in that direction.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	We agree that measuring the effect of TTFields on the anti-angiogenic effect of sorafenib and on resistance to sorafenib are interesting, these topics were however not within the scope of the current study, and remain for future investigations.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	Regarding possible discrepancy between the volume fold change and tumor weight, please see below a graph showing tumor volume (as measured by MRI) versus tumor weight, both measured at the end of the study.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	The graph shows very good correlation between the two parameters, indicating the reliability of the measurements.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	9	1	If the reviewer feels there is discrepancy, it may be due to the volume shown as fold change relative to the initial tumor volume and not as the end value.
					0	Point 9: Was Mycoplasma testing done routinely?
					0	Were the cells checked also for authenticity?
					0	Response 9:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	20	10	1	We routinely examine our cells for Mycoplasma.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	20	10	1	Regarding authenticity, the cells were used shortly after purchase, and so there was no need to examine this.
					0	Point 10: Is there any explanation why the combination of TTFields and sorafenib did not induce a significant level of autophagy as compared to untreated animals which invalid the initial hypothesis that “concomitant application of sorafenib and TTFields may increase stress levels enough to tilt autophagy towards the cell death pathway”.
					0	Response 10: We appreciate this question.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	Autophagy is a process that is elevated in order to cope with cellular stress, but as stress level elevate, autophagy can no longer provide the protection the cell needs, and the cell will undergo apoptosis.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	This kind of kinetics means that the levels of autophagy markers will depend on the time point the cells are examined.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	This may be appreciated from figure 2 panel c and d, with the different kinetics displayed by the two cell lines.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	While for Huh-7D12 autophagy levels increase from 24 to 48 hours of treatment, in the HepG2 cells autophagy levels at 48 hours are lower than at 24 hours, indicating these cells are already after the autophagy peak and on the way to apoptosis.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	Indeed, figure 1d shows higher levels of apoptosis for HepG2 cells.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	To clarify we have added a few sentences to the text.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	In results sub-section 3.2: “However, autophagy kinetics seems to be faster in the HepG2 cells, in which LC3 markers are lower at 48 versus 24 hours, whereas elevation is seen from 24 to 48 hours for the Huh-7D12 cells.” In the discussion “While autophagy serves as a survival strategy of cells, when stress levels continue raising it may be over-activated and mediate cell death [9].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	The faster autophagy kinetics seen for the HepG2 relative to Huh-7D12 cells following application of TTFields is in agreement with the higher apoptosis levels displayed by this cell line, and may serve as an additional rational for the higher efficacy of TTFields against it.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	Examination of the reasons for faster autophagy in HepG2 relative to Huh-7D12 cells is out of the scope of this work.” For more clarity we have also added a more in-depth kinetic study, including additional relevant markers and additional time points, examinations that were performed for the combined treatment as compared to TTFields and sorafenib alone.
					0	We thank the reviewer for this comment, as these additions add much clarity to the mechanism of action of TTFields in combination with sorafenib and provide a more coherent explanation for the in vivo results.
					0	These additions may be seen in Figure 3 and are described in results sub-section 3.4, Autophagy-apoptosis Interplay For Treatment with Concomitant TTFields and Sorafenib: “In order to investigate the mechanism of action of TTFields-sorafenib co-application, HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with TTFields, sorafenib (3µM), or the two modalities together, and then examined for expression levels of various proteins.
					0	For HepG2 cells, the autophagy marker beclin-1 demonstrated elevation after 6 hours of treatment, which was later replaced with diminished expression levels (Figure 3d).
					0	This type of behavior was seen in all treatment groups, but was most pronounced for TTFields-sorafenib co-application.
					0	The autophagy marker LC3 also displayed such bi-phasic characteristics, but with a somewhat slower kinetics, showing some elevation at 6 hours of treatment, but higher elevation at the 24 hours time point (Figure 3d).
					0	As in the case of beclin-1, the magnitude of the effect was higher for co-treatment of TTFields and sorafenib relative to the monotherapies.
					0	GRP78, a marker of ER stress, remained low in all treatment groups for 6 and 24 hours of treatment, but demonstrated elevated levels at the later, 48-hours time point (Figure 3e).
					0	The apoptosis marker cleaved PARP displayed increased expression in the combined group already after 24 hours, elevating even further after 48 hours of treatment.
					0	For the monotherapies, cleaved PARP increase was only evident at 48 hours of treatment, and to a lower extent than that in the co-treatment group (Figure 3f).
					0	The slower kinetics of the autophagy-apoptosis path in the Huh-7D12 cells, as seen from the elevation of LC3 after as much as 48 hours (Figure 2c and d), prevented from detecting such changes in the levels of these markers in this cell line (Figure S1).” And in the discussion part “Kinetic examination in the HepG2 cells revealed elevation in autophagy levels as early as 6 hours of TTFields or sorafenib treatment, which diminished and were replaced with ER stress and apoptosis for 48 hours of treatment.
					0	These results are in line with a previous study that focused on the effects of sorafenib on such markers in HepG2 cells [32].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	The higher changes in expression levels and faster kinetics when TTFields and sorafenib were applied together rather than alone indicate higher stress levels imposed on the cells in the former case” Figure 3.
					0	HepG2 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with 150 kHz TTFields, 3 µM sorafenib, or the two treatments combined, followed by Western blot examination of the autophagy markers beclin-1 and LC3 (d), the ER stress marker GRP78 (e), and the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP (f).

Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	In the animal study we may only measure one time point.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	The lower autophagy seen at this time for the combined treatment together with the higher apoptosis indicate that we are further along the kinetic timeline of autophagy relative to the monotherapies, suggesting higher stress in animals receiving the combined treatment.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	11	1	We have now added IHC examination of beclin-1, an additional autophagy marker, and of GRP78, a marker for ER stress, as described in results sub-section 3.4.
					0	Concomitant TTFields with Sorafenib Enhances Treatment Efficacy in Vivo: “Tumor histology and immunostaining for beclin-1 and LC3, GRP78, and cleaved PARP were performed to examine autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis levels, respectively.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	Beclin-1 levels were increased more than 4-fold relative to control in all treatment groups, while intensity of LC3 staining was increased about 3-fold relative to control in the individual TTFields and sorafenib groups, but only 2-fold in the combination group (Figure 4e).
					0	GRP78 levels in the groups treated with TTFields or sorafenib alone remained unchanged from the control, but were elevated 2-fold in the TTFields plus sorafenib group (Figure 4f).
					0	Additionally, the percentage of cells positive for cleaved PARP was significantly higher relative to control only in the combination group (Figure 4g).” and also in the discussion: “The lower autophagy accompanied by the higher ER stress and apoptosis displayed in the conjunction group relative to the monotherapies groups following 6 days of treatment suggest that these animals were pushed further along the autophagy-apoptosis kinetic timeline due to the higher levels of stress experienced by these animals, in accordance with the results described for the cell cultures.” Figure 4. tumor slices were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for beclin-1 and LC3 (e), GRP78 (f), and cleaved PARP (g).

					0	Point 11: The statement “TTFields concomitant with sorafenib induced a significant increase in apoptosis’ in the abstract section is overstated.
					0	When compared with sorafenib alone there is practically no difference.
					0	Moreover, TTFields failed to increases apoptosis when added to sorafenib and compared to sorafenib alone in one out of two human cells line investigated.
					0	Response 11: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	12	1	The sentence referred to was meant to describe only the in vivo outcomes.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	12	1	We have rephrased it to be more accurate and clear: “While each treatment alone elevated levels of autophagy relative to control, TTFields concomitant with sorafenib induced a significant increase versus control in tumor ER stress and apoptosis levels, demonstrating increased stress under the multimodal treatment.” Point 12: Finally, adding to all the above questions, I found a very weak Discussion section which must be extended.
					0	Moreover, in the Discussion section, the authors concluded that “TTFields display efficacy for treatment of HCC in vitro and in vivo, with an optimal frequency of 150 kHz”.
					0	This is not a correct statement.
					0	While for in vitro data, the authors have data, for in vivo they used only one frequency of 150 Hz.
					0	At least one different dose should have been studied for comparison since this is a completely different tumor environment than the in vitro one.
					0	Response 12:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	13	1	We thanks the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	13	1	We have now elaborated on many issues throughout the discussion, as was described thorough this response letter.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	13	1	Regarding the conclusion, we have rephrased it for better accuracy: “TTFields were identified to be most efficient for treatment of HCC cells at 150 kHz, and this frequency further demonstrated in vivo efficacy.” Why only one frequency was used in vivo, and the difference between frequency and dose, were explained in response 4.
					0	Response to Reviewer 4 Comments In general, the manuscript is well written and provides novel and interesting data illustrating the possibility to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
					0	This might be achieved by using the combination of so-called Tumor Treating fields (TTFields) with targeted drug, I have the following suggestions about this manuscript: Point 1: The authors demonstrate the efficacy of TTFields in vivo even when used as monotherapy.
					0	As shown in the Figure 4 C and D, TTFields were found less effective in terms of reducing the tumors volume and weight when compared with sorafenib.
					0	However, no differences in expression of LC3 marker were observed between these groups (treated with TTFields or with sorafenib) (as shown in Figure 4D).
					0	Similarly, low evidence of apoptosis (expression of cleaved PARP) was found in these groups, as shown in Figure 4F.
					0	What is the mechanism illustrating higher efficiency of sorafenib against HCC?
					0	Response 1: We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	Indeed, the sorafenib dose used in this study proved to be slightly more efficacious than TTFields in controlling tumor fold increase.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	Nevertheless, these differences between the monotherapies, did not reach statistical significance.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	In accordance, there was no statistical difference between the monotherapies in the expression levels of the LC3 marker and the levels of cleaved PARP.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	In order to better understand the mechanism of action, we have added experiments to better characterize the autophagy-apoptosis interplay for treatment with concomitant TTFields and sorafenib, which are described in response 3.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	24	1	1	Of note, the clinical development of TTFields does not aim to replace sorafenib with TTFields, but rather to add TTFields on top of sorafenib and therefore this work focused mainly on the potential added value in combining these 2 modalities.
					0	Point 2: Despite the expression of cleaved PARP was very low in the tumors treated with TTFields or sorafenib alone (as shown in IHC-images in Figure 4F), the authors declare about ~ 20% of positive cells, as show in the graphs below IHC-staining.
					0	Similar, the graphs illustrating the LC3 expression are not in a proper fit with the images shown in Figure 4D.
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	Quantification of the IHC images was done automatically.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	The whole slide was scanned, and the CaseViewer software was used to exclude non-tumor areas.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	The signals of the stained protein and the nuclei were resolved by color deconvolution and quantified separately using the FIJI software (ImageJ) software.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	Average signal per cell or percent of positive cells was calculated.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	25	2	1	As the reviewer pointed out, the high magnification images we chose to show do not correctly reflect the quantification performed by the software, and we have now replaced them with better representative fields of the slides.
					0	Point 3: It will be much better to provide the data to explain the mechanisms illustrating why the monotherapy of TTFields or sorafenib induced autophagy, whereas the tumors treated with combination developed the substantial apoptotic death of tumor cells.
					0	Response 3: We sincerely appreciate this well-taken comment.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	26	3	1	To better explain the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis we have performed additional examinations to include more markers and at additional time points.
					0	These examinations were performed for the combined treatment as compared to TTFields and sorafenib alone.
					0	We thank the reviewer for this comment, as these additions add much clarity to the mechanism of action of TTFields in combination with sorafenib and provide a more coherent explanation for the in vivo results.
					0	These additions may be seen in Figure 3 and are described in results sub-section 3.4, Autophagy-apoptosis Interplay For Treatment with Concomitant TTFields and Sorafenib: “In order to investigate the mechanism of action of TTFields-sorafenib co-application, HepG2 and Huh-7D12 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with TTFields, sorafenib (3µM), or the two modalities together, and then examined for expression levels of various proteins.
					0	For HepG2 cells, the autophagy marker beclin-1 demonstrated elevation after 6 hours of treatment, which was later replaced with diminished expression levels (Figure 3d).
					0	This type of behavior was seen in all treatment groups, but was most pronounced for TTFields-sorafenib co-application.
					0	The autophagy marker LC3 also displayed such bi-phasic characteristics, but with a somewhat slower kinetics, showing some elevation at 6 hours of treatment, but higher elevation at the 24 hours time point (Figure 3d).
					0	As in the case of beclin-1, the magnitude of the effect was higher for co-treatment of TTFields and sorafenib relative to the monotherapies.
					0	GRP78, a marker of ER stress, remained low in all treatment groups for 6 and 24 hours of treatment, but demonstrated elevated levels at the later, 48-hours time point (Figure 3e).
					0	The apoptosis marker cleaved PARP displayed increased expression in the combined group already after 24 hours, elevating even further after 48 hours of treatment.
					0	For the monotherapies, cleaved PARP increase was only evident at 48 hours of treatment, and to a lower extent than that in the co-treatment group (Figure 3f).
					0	The slower kinetics of the autophagy-apoptosis path in the Huh-7D12 cells, as seen from the elevation of LC3 after as much as 48 hours (Figure 2c and d), prevented from detecting such changes in the levels of these markers in this cell line (Figure S1).” And in the discussion part “Kinetic examination in the HepG2 cells revealed elevation in autophagy levels as early as 6 hours of TTFields or sorafenib treatment, which diminished and were replaced with ER stress and apoptosis for 48 hours of treatment.
					0	These results are in line with a previous study that focused on the effects of sorafenib on such markers in HepG2 cells [32].
					0	The higher changes in expression levels and faster kinetics when TTFields and sorafenib were applied together rather than alone indicate higher stress levels imposed on the cells in the former case.” Figure 3.
					0	HepG2 cells were treated for 6, 24, or 48 hours with 150 kHz TTFields, 3 µM sorafenib, or the two treatments combined, followed by Western blot examination of the autophagy markers beclin-1 and LC3 (d), the ER stress marker GRP78 (e), and the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP (f).
					0	Values are mean (N ≥ 3) ± SEM.
					0	*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 relative to time-respective control; two-way ANOVA.
					0	In the animal study we have now added IHC examination of beclin-1 and of GRP78, a marker for ER stress, as described in results sub-section 3.4.
					0	Concomitant TTFields with Sorafenib Enhances Treatment Efficacy in Vivo: “Tumor histology and immunostaining for beclin-1 and LC3, GRP78, and cleaved PARP were performed to examine autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis levels, respectively.
					0	Beclin-1 levels were increased more than 4-fold relative to control in all treatment groups, while intensity of LC3 staining was increased about 3-fold relative to control in the individual TTFields and sorafenib groups, but only 2-fold in the combination group (Figure 4e).
					0	GRP78 levels in the groups treated with TTFields or sorafenib alone remained unchanged from the control, but were elevated 2-fold in the TTFields plus sorafenib group (Figure 4f).
					0	Additionally, the percentage of cells positive for cleaved PARP was significantly higher relative to control only in the combination group (Figure 4g).” and also in the discussion: “The lower autophagy accompanied by the higher ER stress and apoptosis displayed in the conjunction group relative to the monotherapies groups following 6 days of treatment suggest that these animals were pushed further along the autophagy-apoptosis kinetic timeline due to the higher levels of stress experienced by these animals, in accordance with the results described for the cell cultures.” Figure 4. tumor slices were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for beclin-1 and LC3 (e), GRP78 (f), and cleaved PARP (g).
					0	Values are mean ± SD.
					0	*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ****p < 0.0001 relative to control for labels above bars, or between indicated groups; Student’s T-test.
					0	Point 4: Since Annexin V/7-ADD data was not convincing and the authors observed the minor increase of apoptotic cells after HCC cells were treated with combination of TTFields and sorafenib (when compared to the cells treated with TTFields and sorafenib alone), I suggest to run the WBs to examine the expression of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3 (for both HCC cell lines).
					0	This might be helpful and make the in vitro data more relevant with the data shown in vivo.
					0	Response 4: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	27	4	1	Both cell lines experience elevation of apoptosis following application of sorafenib in a dose dependent manner, as evident from the AnnV/7AAD results.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	27	4	1	However, while TTFields greatly elevate apoptosis in HepG2 cells, they have a low effect on apoptosis levels in the Huh-7D12 cells, seen both in Figure 1d and in Figure 3c.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	27	4	1	As was explained in the discussion, this difference between the cell lines may be attributed to the different p53 status, wild type in HepG2 and mutated in Huh-7D12, as there are previous indications of lower TTFields-induced apoptosis in cell lines with mutated p53.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	27	4	1	As suggested by the reviewer, in order to back up the AnnV/7AAD results we added WB for cleaved PARP, as described in response 3.
					0	Point 5: Figure 4A is missing.
					0	Response 5:
Author	Reviewer_4	2	28	5	1	We apologize for accidentally leaving out this figure, and have now added it.
					0	Point 6: the different HCC cell lines were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments, therefore making difficult to compare these data.
					0	Response 6: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	29	6	1	In the in vitro experiments we used cell lines derived from humans.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	29	6	1	However, these cell lines cannot be implanted to rats, and so for the in vivo experiments we had to use a cell line from rats.
