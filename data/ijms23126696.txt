The paper by Puengel and colleagues concerns the use of CCR2 / CCR5 antagonists and FGF21 analogues in the treatment of non-aloholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NAFLD and NASH are pathologies of great hepatological interest because, not only its incidence is constantly growing, but also because in 20/30% of cases, NASH can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma or, more rarely, cholangiocarcinoma.
Furthermore, currently available therapies for the treatment of NASH are dismal and it is impossible to reduce fibrotic scar, especially in the advanced stages of disease.
The paper is clear and well written and the data is very interesting.
Furthermore, the results are convincing and support the idea behind the work.
The main results obtained by Authors are: 1.
Serum concentrations of CCL2 and FGF21 correlate with different disease severity readouts.
2.
Using NASH models, in vivo treatments with CCR2/5 inhibitors (CCL2 receptors), with FGF21 analogues or with a mix of them, induce a general remission of the disease and in particular of MoMF recruitment.
3.
Similarly to what was seen in the mouse model of NASH (chronic damage), even in case of acute damage with CCl4, the treatment with the same compounds gives a relief of the disease.
I have a few concerns about this job: · Since NAFLD/NASH show clear gender differences, with a higher incidence on the male population and since the Authors used only male mice for the in vivo experiments, it would be interesting to evaluate the data of figure 1 (CCL1 and FGF21 secretion and correlation with disease readouts), not only as a single group, but also splitted by gender.
· To confirm the data in supplementary figures 1 and 2B, since an IHC was done for macrophages (f4-80), I would ask to do IHC for other immune cell populations on liver sections of control and treated mice.
· A graphical abstract or an explanatory drawing would be very much appreciated, in order to better clarify the mechanism that has been demonstrated.
To explore the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH are liver diseases research hotspot.
NASH are charactered by steatosis and hepatitis, and some cases could develop to fibrosis/cirrhosis and HCC.
In this article, CDAHFD was used to set up mice NASH plus fibrosis model.
Authors set up the combined therapy with CCR2/CCR5 antagonist (BMS-687681) and FGF21 analogue synergizes PEG-FGF21 variant (BMS-986171) to inhibit inflammatory reaction and reduce lipid deposition in liver.
HE, IHC of F4/80 and Sirius Red were used to observe liver pathological changes.
FACS was used to check inflammatory cells changes in peripheral blood and liver.
Combined therapy ameliorated steatohepatitis and fibrosis, and they are new approaches to treat NASH patients.
It is quite an interesting research article and would help us explore the innovative approach to treat the increasing NAFLD and NASH; however, I still have a few concerns regarding the manuscript.

The study by Puengel et al.
describes a two-pronged approach for alleviating NASH and aspects of acute liver injury by targeting CCR2/5 and FGF21.
The data includes human patient data with NAFLD/NASH at different fibrotic stages, multiple mouse models using the CDAHFD diet, and an acute injury CCl4 model.
Overall, the study is well designed in describing how combined therapy may be useful for targeting metabolic (FGF21) and inflammatory (CCR2/5) components of inflammatory fatty liver disease.
The addition of characterization of blood and liver immune cells adds a mechanistic approach which is a strength of this study.
That being said, there are areas the authors need to address to improve their study: 1) My biggest concern with the data as presented has to do with the CDAHFD model and the conclusions drawn from it.
Did all of the CDAHFD groups have similar consumption of the diet?
All of the treatments had a weight drop after the treatment started in week 6.
In particular the combined group went from ~24g to ~19g from weeks 6-8.
This supports that they likely could have had reduced food intake following treatment.
Without reporting this data, the conclusion could be made that all effects in the CDAHFD model were due to changes in food consumption, which reduced their exposure to the CDAHFD diet, and therefore showed anti-inflammatory and reduced hepatic lipid deposition effects compared to the vehicle group.
Food consumption must be reported to alleviate this potential alternative hypothesis.
2) For human data, it would have strengthened this report to have BMI/sex-matched control patients and report their CCL2, FGF21 and CK18 values.
3) Validation of CCL2/5 inhibition should be shown by showing a reduction of downstream signaling such as MAPK.
The other possibility would be to show that CCL2 and CCL5 mRNA were unchanged in liver following treatment with inhibitors and then subsequently adding this data to supplemental figure 1E.
4) Was there any mortality in the CCR2/5i + FGF21 groups?
Their weights at 12 weeks appear to be dropping?
Was this weight drop significant compared to eh CDAHFD Vhc group?
Was there any change in appearance or overall well being of the mice?
This needs to be reported in the text.
5) With the protective effects of FGF21v for some measures in the CCl4 model, is it possible that FGF21v treatment changes metabolism of CCl4 by changing cytochrome p450 activity (such as CYP2E1)?
This needs to be checked for both CCR2/5i and FGF21v groups to ensure conclusions of these groups are appropriate.
The Authors satisfactorily answered the question raised by the reviewer.
The paper is definitively improved and worthy of publication.
The authors have answered my primary concern with this study which was the use of the CDAHFD diet and potential complications of mice.
No model is perfect and the fact there was no mortality associated with the weight drop in some treatment groups alleviates my major concern regarding the potential of combined therapy for patient populations in the future.
While I would have preferred some measures to be included (such as food consumption) the authors adequately explained rationale for not being able to do so.
I have no significant remaining concerns with this study.
Point-to-point Responses to the Reviewers’ Comments Reviewer 1 The paper by Puengel and colleagues concerns the use of CCR2 / CCR5 antagonists and FGF21 analogues in the treatment of non-aloholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

3.
Similarly to what was seen in the mouse model of NASH (chronic damage), even in case of acute damage with CCl4, the treatment with the same compounds gives a relief of the disease.
I have a few concerns about this job: Response: We cordially thank the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation of our manuscript.
1) Since NAFLD/NASH show clear gender differences, with a higher incidence on the male population and since the Authors used only male mice for the in vivo experiments, it would be interesting to evaluate the data of figure 1 (CCL1 and FGF21 secretion and correlation with disease readouts), not only as a single group, but also splitted by gender.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her expert comment.
We fully agree that NAFLD is strongly influenced by gender.
Male individuals predominantly show more severe stages of NAFLD such as NASH and fibrosis than female individuals during the reproductive age.
However, after menopause, NAFLD occurs at a higher rate in women, supporting that estrogen is protective.
As rightfully commented by the reviewer, we added gender specific analyses as new Supplementary Figure 1: Detailed data overview for the reviewer: No advanced fibrosis Advanced fibrosis P value CCL2 Total cohort 335.3 (275.3-413.7) 432.8 (332.8-647.8) < 0.001 Men 320.8 (261-2-406.6) 390.8 (298.7-656.2) 0.027 Women 371.2 (329.5-453.7) 485.8 (412.0-639.5) 0.064 FGF-21 Total cohort 260.6 (158.5-536.0) 674.8 (288.9-855.6) 0.067 Men 277.7 (213.9-537.3) 521.0 (251.4-843.1) 0.394 Women 159.8 (154-8-373.0) 679.8 (296.4-1174.5) 0.045 NAFL NASH P value CCL2 Total cohort 342.8 (267.0-400.3) 349.5 (295.3-451.2) 0.168 Men 342.8 (234.5-420.8) 322.0 (277.8-414.5) 0.393 Women 354.5 (319.5-400.3) 451.2 (370.3-487.8) 0.233 FGF-21 Total cohort 253.9 (156.4-572.3) 296.4 (194.8-562.3) 0.344 Men 265.6 (176.0-572.7) 313.1 (222.3-516.8) 0.398 Women 182.3 (156.4-541.4) 288.9 (157.3-927.3) 0.620 Total cohort, n = 85 Men, n = 65 Women, n = 20 However, we have to be careful interpreting the data based on our patient cohort, because the above-mentioned gender impact was also apparent in our clinical cohort.
As expected from the literature (1), our cohort that was enriched for advanced disease stages displayed a lower number of female than male patients (total female patients n = 20 vs n = 65 males).
In the gender specific analyses we observed a significant correlation between CCL2 serum levels and advanced fibrosis stages in male patients as well as a positive trend in female patients (p = 0.064).
However, statistical power is depressed mainly based on the low numbers of cases employing the gender specific analyses and the results demonstrated based on the whole cohort are more reliable.
This is now mentioned and discussed in the revised manuscript (Section 2.1, line 123 to 128 and in the discussion line 348 to 361).
The reviewer is totally right about the comment regarding the use of male C57BL/6J mice.
This is a common strategy in the field to reduce the number of mice (3R principle), since male mice are more susceptible to experimental NAFLD models and generally display a stronger, more reproducible and less variable phenotype.
This is likely related to the hepato-protective functions of estrogen signaling.
Therefore, employing male C57BL/6J wildtype is meant to reduce potential disease modifying factors.
2) To confirm the data in supplementary figures 1 and 2B, since an IHC was done for macrophages (f4-80), I would ask to do IHC for other immune cell populations on liver sections of control and treated mice.
Response: We would like to thank the reviewer his/her helpful suggestion to further improve the manuscript.
The immune cell analyses in the current manuscript focus on macrophages (and other myeloid cells), since the CCR2/5 inhibition only affected these populations and the FGF-21 agonism did not directly impact immune cells.
We provided detailed FACS analyses from circulating blood and liver tissue to demonstrate the lack of therapeutic effects on lymphocytes.
Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that lymphocytes are involved in NAFLD/NASH and deserve detailed understanding.
We are currently running large-scale multiplex immunostaining on immune cell subsets.
Part of this ongoing project is being presented at this year’s International Liver Congress (EASL meeting) in June 2022 in London (accepted for poster presentation, #SAT040 “Multiplex immunostaining and transcriptomic profiling identify novel immune cell markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis” from our group).
Since the lymphoid populations do not directly relate to the therapeutic effects of the interventions, we would rather continue with the detailed characterization of lymphoid reactions in mouse NAFLD models in the already started follow-up project (for which definite results will not be immediately available).
In addition, we emphasized the cross reference in the main manuscript to Suppl.
Figure 3A and B demonstrating that CCR2/5 inhibition is mainly followed by significant reduction of infiltrating MoMF without affecting lymphoid immune cell populations (line 184 to 187.
3) A graphical abstract or an explanatory drawing would be very much appreciated, in order to better clarify the mechanism that has been demonstrated.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his truly helpful comment and include a graphical abstract to the manuscript clarifying the essential underlying mechanisms and key messages: Reference: (1) Lonardo, A., Nascimbeni, F., Ballestri, S., Fairweather, D., Win, S., Than, T.A., Abdelmalek, M.F.

2) Fig 1 A, human serum CCl2 concentration positively correlated with liver fibrosis level.
Whether did liver inflammatory level correlate with serum CCl2?
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her expert comment.
In this study, we demonstrate that CCL2 serum levels correlate with biopsy proven advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) withstanding multivariate analysis.
CCL2 serum levels were also associated with fibrosis based on non-invasive FIB-4 score (not significant for CK-18 M30 levels).
On the contrary, there was no significant relationship between CCL2 levels and NASH activity based on NAS (neither for lobular inflammation (p=0.401), nor ballooning (p=0.323).
Differently from FGF21 serum levels which correlated with AST and GGT (and non-significantly with CK-18 M30), CCL2 serum concentrations did not correlate with non-invasive biomarkers of steatohepatitis (AST, GGT).
We added the analyses to the new Supplementary Figure 1C and mentioned all results in the revised manuscript (line 123 to 132): 3) In Materials and Methods, 4.5.

Point-to-point Responses to the Reviewers’ Comments Reviewer 3 The study by Puengel et al.
describes a two-pronged approach for alleviating NASH and aspects of acute liver injury by targeting CCR2/5 and FGF21.
The data includes human patient data with NAFLD/NASH at different fibrotic stages, multiple mouse models using the CDAHFD diet, and an acute injury CCl4 model.
Overall, the study is well designed in describing how combined therapy may be useful for targeting metabolic (FGF21) and inflammatory (CCR2/5) components of inflammatory fatty liver disease.
The addition of characterization of blood and liver immune cells adds a mechanistic approach which is a strength of this study.
That being said, there are areas the authors need to address to improve their study: Response: We highly appreciate the positive evaluation of our manuscript by the reviewer.
1) My biggest concern with the data as presented has to do with the CDAHFD model and the conclusions drawn from it.
Did all of the CDAHFD groups have similar consumption of the diet?
All of the treatments had a weight drop after the treatment started in week 6.
In particular the combined group went from ~24g to ~19g from weeks 6-8.
This supports that they likely could have had reduced food intake following treatment.
Without reporting this data, the conclusion could be made that all effects in the CDAHFD model were due to changes in food consumption, which reduced their exposure to the CDAHFD diet, and therefore showed anti-inflammatory and reduced hepatic lipid deposition effects compared to the vehicle group.
Food consumption must be reported to alleviate this potential alternative hypothesis.
Response: We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her detailed observation of our experimental NASH model.
As mentioned in the discussion the “ideal” NASH model reflecting all aspects of the human disease does not exist but CDAHFD fed mice develop severe fibrosis and steatohepatitis (1).
Nonetheless, systemic features of the metabolic dysregulation (such as obesity or insulin resistance) are less well reflected by the CDAHFD model.
The CDAHFD is a commonly used diet in the NAFLD research field to induce experimental NASH in which an initial weight loss of the mice can usually be observed followed by stabilisation of the bodyweight (2).
We particularly opted for this model, because it allows to study inflammatory as well as fibrogenic pathways simultaneously, which we considered mandatory to assess the combined effects of FGF-21 analogues and CCR2/5 inhibitors in a translationally relevant study.
All experiments were performed under conditions approved by the appropriate institutional and governmental authorities according to German legal requirements with regular weight controls and no individual mouse lost ≥20% bodyweight compared to the initial weight from the start of the experiment.
Regarding the differential effects of the various compounds on body weight, we did not exactly measure the individual food intake of the mice.
However, body weight loss is a well-known mechanism of action of FGF-21 agonists, which is also reflected in our data.
Previous studies in other mouse models are in line with our work and show that these effects are not related to food intake.
In particular, Fisher et al.
showed that FGF-21 KO aggravated NAFLD in the MCD diet model, which is associated with even more weight loss compared to our CDAHFD model.
FGF-21 KO increased body weight and hepatic lipid accumulation through suppression of mitochondrial beta- oxidation, while FGF-21 administration reduced lipid accumulation and inflammation (3).
In contrast, the weight loss in the CCR2/5 inhibitor-only group was not significantly different from the vehicle-treated group, in keeping with the mechanism of action, again suggesting that food intake did not play a major role in the observed outcome.
To act on the reviewer´s suggestion, we extended the description in reference to the bodyweight development of the mice in the manuscript (line 170 – 175 and in the discussion line 374 to 377 ) 2) For human data, it would have strengthened this report to have BMI/sex- matched control patients and report their CCL2, FGF21 and CK18 values.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her expert comment and would like to refer to the first comment of reviewer 1.
As both reviewers rightfully mentioned, we included gender-specific analyses as new Supplementary Figure 1 to the manuscript (Section 2.1, line 124 to 134 and in the discussion line 355 to 370).
Matched healthy control patients were not included in our cohort, in part because liver biopsies from obese patients without signs of NAFLD were not easily available given the lack of indication to perform the biopsy.
Nonetheless, we hope that these new analyses fully answer the posed questions.
3) Validation of CCL2/5 inhibition should be shown by showing a reduction of downstream signaling such as MAPK.
The other possibility would be to show that CCL2 and CCL5 mRNA were unchanged in liver following treatment with inhibitors and then subsequently adding this data to supplemental figure 1E.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his comment and would like to point to Supplementary Figure 1E demonstrating serum concentrations of CCL2 and CCL5 as well as Ccl2 gene expression levels from total liver tissue, labelled as Mcp1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 = CCL2).
We confirmed effective dosing of the CCR2/5 inhibitor by measuring CCL2 serum concentrations, which are significantly increased upon pharmacological blockade of CCR2 as also previously reported from our group as well as from clinical trials in NASH patients (4).
In reference to our answer of the second comment of reviewer 1, CCR5 orchestrates migration, activation, and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as well as recruitment of lymphocyte populations (natural killer cells, T cells) to the liver, that is mainly related to viral or (auto-)immune hepatitis.
In this study, we focus on monocytes and macrophages, since the CCR2/5 inhibition only affected these populations, which is mainly mediated by the CCR2/CCL2 axis.
4) Was there any mortality in the CCR2/5i + FGF21 groups?
Their weights at 12 weeks appear to be dropping?
Was this weight drop significant compared to eh CDAHFD Vhc group?
Was there any change in appearance or overall well being of the mice?
This needs to be reported in the text.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her comment and would like to refer to our answer of the first comment.
We did not observe any negative side effects due to the compound treatment, neither in the single compound nor in the combinational treatment group.
In particular, no mortality was observed, as this is now stated in the manuscript (line 169 – 170).
As correctly described by the reviewer, we observed a conspicuous weight loss in the FGF21 similar treated mice as well as in the combinational treatment - but less prominent in the CCR2/5 inhibitor treated mice - leading us to the conclusion that this effect is mainly directed by the FGF21 agonism.
The potential of FGF21 to protect mice from diet induced obesity is extensively reported in the literature (5, 6).
We would like to emphasize that all experiments were performed under conditions approved by the appropriate institutional and governmental authorities according to German legal requirements with regular weight controls and no individual mouse lost ≥20% bodyweight compared to baseline.
5) With the protective effects of FGF21v for some measures in the CCl4 model, is it possible that FGF21v treatment changes metabolism of CCl4 by changing cytochrome p450 activity (such as CYP2E1)?
This needs to be checked for both CCR2/5i and FGF21v groups to ensure conclusions of these groups are appropriate.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her expert comment.
The acute CCl4 liver injury model is accompanied by hepatic inflammatory processes in which necrotic hepatocytes release danger-associated-molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate macrophages, Kupffer cells and neutrophils.
Activated immune cells release cytokines (e.g.
TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokines (e.g.
CCL2 via CCR2) that result in the recruitment of bone-marrow derived monocytes and neutrophils.
As we observed a comparable reduction of hepatic MoMF in experimental CDAHFD-induced NASH, we employed the acute CCl4 liver injury model to elucidate effects of both therapies on accumulation of hepatic monocytes and MoMF.
As previously shown by our group we confirmed that CCR2/5 antagonism blocks monocyte infiltration into the liver.
On the contrary, we could exclude direct effects of the FGF21 similar treatment on immune cell recruitment.
As FGF21 application did not influence monocyte infiltration or recruitment of other immune cells we speculate that reduced numbers of hepatic MoMFs in the experimental NASH model were rather indirect effects due to beneficial metabolic modification.
To date, the mode of action of FGF21 and its downstream targets are not fully understood and future studies are definitely needed to answer open questions.
Given the lack of FGF-21 effect on monocyte infiltration and hepatocyte necrosis following CCl4 administration, it is unlikely that metabolization of CCl4 was a major factor in its lowering of ALT levels, as otherwise these readouts would also have been affected.
