					0	Author Response There might be some interesting data collected in the present study.
					0	However,
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	my main concern with the study is that there were too many analyses presented to interpret in a meaningful way.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The authors should revise the paper providing more theoretical background and accompanying analyses.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	With better theoretical framing and a more limited set of analyses, the value of the study results should be more clear.
					0	Some more specific suggestions are provided below.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Thank you for this advice.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We have trimmed the paper to focus on two of the five elements of sexual subjectivity - only those that were expected to be most relevant to partnered sexual partner: entitlement to sexual partner pleasure and efficacy in achieving pleasure.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This has substantially limited the analyses conducted.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We provide a rationale for this (see the first paragraph on p.4) and have thoroughly revised the entire paper.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	I think it would be preferable to describe the measurement of sexual subjectivity shortly after it is defined on p. 3.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Also, a more thorough description of the measurement of the construct and the validity of the measurement could be described in that section.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We have done this and have also substantially revised the entire Introduction (see new section starting on p. 3 titled Definition and measurement).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	On p. 4 the first sentence of second full paragraph, “Regarding sexual subjectivity and its link to greater sexual exploration and experience, one cross-sectional with a sample of females” is missing the word “study.” **
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We have corrected this sentence.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors could provide more theoretical explanation of why there might be gender differences in sexual subjectivity.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We have added to our theoretical explanation for why there would be gender differences (see the section titled Gender Differences in Sexual Behavior, Attitudes, and Sexual Subjectivity, p. 4).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	The authors rely too much on headings to transition between ideas.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	The paper would flow more smoothly if some transition sentences were included.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	We have substantially revised all sections of this paper to improve the flow and removed some headings.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	More specific hypotheses could be proposed.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	The section where research questions are described is worded in an awkward way.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We have revised this section (The Current Study, p.5).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We have also added hypotheses (see p. 5-6)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	The reporting of group differences in the participants section might be better placed in the results section after the measures are described.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	We have moved this content on group difference to the first section of the Results section.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	The combining of the male and female versions of the sexual subjectivity inventories should be described in more detail, and the validity of creating the subscales should be explained.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Perhaps factor analysis could be used to determine appropriate subscales?
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Given our focus on only two element of sexual subjectivity, this was no longer an issue because items were the same on measures for males and females.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	What were participants told about the purpose of the study?
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	We have added this information on p. 7 in the Procedure section.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	It reads: Approval from the university Human Research Ethics Committee was obtained prior to data collection.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	"At Time 1 (T1), participants were approached at a university campus in Australia in the week before classes commenced (i.e., during orientation week) and asked to participate in a study ""About You and Your Relationships."""
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	The front cover of the survey described the questions as focused on personal sexual and romantic experiences, and stressed the confidential nature of the survey.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	There is an increase in Type I error with the multiple t-tests conducted thatshould be addressed.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Similarly, there are many correlation tests performed which increases Type I error that needs to be addressed.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	Reducing the number of elements of sexual subjectivity has reduced the number of tests performed.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	11	0	2	Predictions about how the specific subscales of the inventory might relate to age and experience might be provided to make the results more meaningful (see the comment about theory relating to analyses discussed above).
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	11	1	We have added hypotheses to the section titled The Current Study on p. 5-6.
					0	Author Response This paper presents results from a longitudinal study of sexual subjectivity in university-age students who were followed over the course of 1 year.
					0	The normative development of sexual health is an important and understudied topic, and the Introduction to this paper provides a good overview of the theoretical work in this area.
					0	I have four recommendations for improving the paper.
					0	***Thank you for the compliments and the suggestions.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	First, the attrition between Time 1 and Time 2 was substantial (40% of participants), and this is handled using list-wise deletion.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	That is, any one who did not complete both assessments was not included in the analyses.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	List-wise deletion can lead to serious bias in results.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Analyses should be re-done using a more sophisticated method for handling missing data, such as multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood (Shafer & Graham, 2002, Psychological Methods).
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	1	1	We have now used multiple imputation to maintain all 295 participants in all analyses.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	"Second, potential participants were ""approached at a university campus"" during orientation week."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	What percentage of people who were approached agreed to participate?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	How broadly representative of the university population (or the university-age population) is the sample?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	From the relatively high percentage of non-heterosexual participants, there seems to be some selection bias.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	At the very least, the Discussion should consider how generalizable these results are.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	We are sorry that we did not keep a tally of the number of students approached.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	We have added to the Limitations section of the Discussion about this (see p. 12).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	It reads, First, the participants in the study were predominantly middle class, Caucasian university students, residing in one region of Australia.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	There is also the possibility that individuals more interested in sex and relationships chose to participate.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	Therefore, the results of the current study may have some limited generalizability.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Third, although longitudinal data can be a quite powerful tool for understanding change and development, the current analyses squander some of that power.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	The regression results presented in Table 2 test whether sexual behaviors that participants already experienced by Time 1 predicted facets of sexual subjectivity at Time 2, controlling for sexual subjectivity at Time 1.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Why would behavior that has already happened contribute to a re-ordering of individuals over the course of the next year?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	It seems that a more interesting and direct test of the longitudinal effects of sexual behavior on sexual subjectivity would test whether new sexual behaviors (that is, sexual behaviors experienced between Time 1 and Time 2) predict change in sexual subjectivity from Time 1 to Time 2.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Moreover, the reverse paths -- from sexual subjectivity to future behavior -- are also not tested in this paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	More generally, I think the putative timescale of effects of behavior on sexual subjectivity needs more theoretical elaboration.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Are behaviors in early adolescence (before age 16), for example, expected to continue to influence the trajectory of sexual subjectivity regardless of later sexual behavior?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	That seems to be the model implied by the analyses, but it is never explicitly specified.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	We agree that this is very important.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	We have added the Introduction to expand on these points.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Unfortunately we could not conduct these suggested analyses.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	We had very little change in sexual behavior given the way we measured it.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Also, we did not have confidence in estimation of sexual behavior for those who did not participate at Wave 2, which could have increased the change.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Thus, we have maintained our original analyses, but make this comment in the Discussion (see p. 12-13): Second, probably because the majority of the participants had already experienced coitus prior to the first data collection and because we measured types of sexual behavior and not frequency or some other aspect of behavior, there was high stability in sexual behavior over the one year of this study.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Recent statistics show that the majority of Australian year 10-12 students (approximately 15-17 years) have engaged in some form of sexual behavior [12].
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Therefore, in order to capture sexual subjectivity as it emerges and develops most rapidly along with change in sexual behavior, future studies may need to begin with a younger population.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Recently, Hensel et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	[31] found that, in their adolescent participants, sexual self-concept had a bidirectional relationship with sexual experience, and the same may occur for sexual subjectivity.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Future research could examine the possibility of bidirectional relationships between sexual subjectivity and sexual behavior.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	In addition, no previous study has examined the timing of pubertal development and sexual subjectivity.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Evidence suggests that adolescents that mature earlier, compared to their peers, form romantic relationships earlier and experience sexual behaviors earlier [11,55].
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	In the current and past research, the link between age and sexual subjectivity has been relatively weak [34].
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Substituting timing of pubertal status for age may provide more evidence regarding individual characteristics that influence differences in sexual subjectivity and its development over time.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Fourth, each analysis is conducted for each subscale separately, but (with the exception of sexual body-esteem) the scales are consistently (if moderately) intercorrelated.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	I think it would be informative to test whether associations with age or sexual experience group are operating through a general underlying factor of sexual subjectivity versus are unique to specific facets.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The shift to a latent factor approach would have the added benefit of allowing the authors to use FIML to account for missing data at T2, and they could thus use their entire sample.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	4	1	We have trimmed the paper to focus on two of the five elements of sexual subjectivity and anticipated that these two elements would show different results.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	4	1	Thus, we have maintained the separate analyses of these two elements.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	4	1	Please see the added Hypotheses on p. 5-6.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Fifth, one set of results seems quite contradictory: sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure decreased, on average, from Time 1 to Time 2, but sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure was positively correlated with age.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	How do the authors make sense of these result, as participants are one year older at Time 2?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	This contradiction underscores my concern about attrition (point #1); I wonder if the seeming decrease from Time 1 to Time 2 is an artifact of attrition.
					0	***
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	5	1	We have removed these analyses from the paper in an attempt to reduce the number of analyses and streamline the entire paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	"Finally, on a selfish note, I wrote an extensive review piece on this topic (Harden, 2014, ""A Sex-Positive Framework for Reseach on Adolescent Sexuality"" in Perspectives on Psychological Science), and I would, of course, be happy if the authors included a reference to my paper in their Introduction or Discussion."

Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	6	1	Thank you for this suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	6	1	The reference has been added to the paper.
					0	Author Response Please specify how many students were approached to participate in the study and therefore specify the response rate.
					0	A low response rate will seriously limit the validity of the findings and this should be discussed as an important limitation also.
					0	**We did not keep an exact count of the number of students approached about the study, but we estimate that we approached about 375 students.
					0	We have added this information to the paper.
					0	Important limitations of the study including that this was a study of students at one university only should be included in the Abstract.
					0	** We added a comment that data were collected at one Australian university to the abstract, and added a summary statement and note about limitations related to generalizability.
					0	The abstract now reads: Abstract: Many scholars have called for an increased focus on positive aspects of sexual health and sexuality.
					0	Using a longitudinal design with two assessments, we investigated patterns of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure and self-efficacy to achieve sexual pleasure among 295 young men and women aged 17-25 years attending one Australian university.
					0	We also tested whether entitlement and efficacy differed by gender, and hypothesized that entitlement and efficacy would be higher in older participants and those with more sexual experience.
					0	A sense of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure increased significantly over the year of the study, whereas, on average, there was no change in self-efficacy over time.
					0	At Time 1 (T1), young women reported more entitlement than young men.
					0	Age was positively associated with T1 entitlement, and experience with a wider range of partnered sexual behaviors was concurrently associated with more entitlement and efficacy and was also associated with increased entitlement to partner pleasure and increased self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure at T2 relative to T1.
					0	A group with the least amount of sexual experience was particularly low in entitlement and efficacy when compared to groups with a history of coital experience.
					0	There was no evidence that any association differed between young men and young women.
					0	Limitations of the study include a sample of predominantly middle class, Caucasian students at one university and the possibility that students more interested in sex and relationships, and with more sexual experience, chose to participate.
					0	**We also expanded the first paragraph of the Limitations to say: Although this study provided insight into how aspects of sexual subjectivity differed over one year in young men and women and uncovered associations of age and sexual behavior with sexual subjectivity, there were two limitations worthy of note.
					0	First, the participants in the study were predominantly middle class, Caucasian students at one university, who were residing in one region of Australia.
					0	There is also the possibility that individuals more interested in sex and relationships chose to participate.

					0	Therefore, in order to capture sexual subjectivity as it emerges and develops most rapidly along with sexual behavior, future studies may need to begin with a younger population.
					0	Moreover there is a comment in the Methods that 80% of the subjects reported being only attracted to members of the same sex.
					0	This seems to contrast with later statements and would also seem to be an unlikely finding.
					0	Please address this matter.
					0	"**Thank you catching the typographical error (80% attracted to the same sex) - this should have read ""other sex""."
					0	The first paragraph of the Participants section now reads: The participants were 295 adolescent and young adult men (n = 112) and women (n = 183) aged between 17 to 25 years (M = 19.5 years, SD = 1.9).
					0	Although an exact count was not available, we estimate that 375 students were approached to participate, resulting in a participation rate of approximately 79%.
					0	Participants completed two waves of data collection approximately 1-year apart.
					0	"Overall, 91% were white/Caucasian, 3% were Asian, 1 was Aboriginal/Pacific Islander, and the remaining participants indicated an ""Other"" sociocultural background."
					0	Most lived with their parents (61%) and reported being only attracted to the other sex (80%).
					0	At T1, 225 of the participants (76%) reported a history of sexual intercourse and 9% reported having had no sexual experience apart from kissing.
					0	Please note - we have also shortened the title, found some other typographical errors to fix, and fixed some references.
					0	There might be some interesting data collected in the present study.
					0	However, my main concern with the study is that there were too many analyses presented to interpret in a meaningful way.
