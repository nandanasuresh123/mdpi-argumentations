Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Both compounds are biologically active, but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We appreciate the recommendation and agree with the reviewer that the computational and experimental results of antimicrobial activity differ to some extent in this part of the study and required further investigation to understand why such activity differs to the ligands by other means in the future.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	In this study, we successfully synthesized the novel ligands and studied its spectroscopy with other probable studies.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Fortunately, we have found outstanding results during the chemo-sensor study and hopefully, we could be able to show the excellent usage of the ligands as a chemo-sensor in near future.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Also, we are planning to do a fluorescence imaging study of protein-ligands.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Third one their binding study: 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments.
					0	2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Docking is a preliminary experiment.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	How did the author validate the docking protocol?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors are suggested using some decoy ligands and calculating the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	In addition, authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and the following are the answers in response to the question for the kind consideration of the reviewer- Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis, which is essential for pigmentation.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-103].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	That’s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium was performed.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Also, molecular docking with other proteins of B. Megaterium was conducted, but 46ju provided better binding affinity with the synthesized compounds.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	For this reason, we aim to study the structure of tyrosinase from the bacteria.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Preliminary antimicrobial studies were carried out to validate the docking protocol.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	At present, we are doing the fluorescence activities of these ligands and L2 showed excellent fluorescent emission at λmax 520 nm.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	So, we hope that we will carry out ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments and 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability in the future for our next study since within this shortest time, we are unable to do these experiments.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The active binding site of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	19	12	1	The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We have included this in the manuscript as follows:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	18	11	1	4.9.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	14	1	Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	21	14	1	To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.

Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	4.9.1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Binding affinity of L1 and L2 The highest anti-bacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were calculated by AutoDock Vina.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in the Fig.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	6.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl).
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	6).
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala44A, and ALA44B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which also supports the literature [101-103].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Thus, computational results are in good agreement with in vitro antibacterial behaviour of our compounds for novel antibacterial drug design.

Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	We appreciate the recommendation and changed the conclusion as follows, Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G of the ligands.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	22	15	1	We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands.

Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	We appreciate the recommendation and rewrote the Molecular Docking study as follows as suggested by the reviewer, 4.9.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding of ligand-receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [92-95].
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analyses of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [96-99].
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	The docking results were also compared with well-testified inhibitor arbutin [97].
					0	4.9.1.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Binding affinity of L1 and L2 The highest antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, whereas for arbutin-4j6u the value was -9.1 kcal mol-1 which were calculated by AutoDock Vina.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in Fig.
					0	6.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	It was observed that arbutin formed six conventional hydrogen bonds with 4j6u (Supplementary Fig.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	S11) by the following residues: ALA40A (one O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), Glu141A (four O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), and LYS47B (one O-H----O-C hydro-gen bond).
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Also several hydrophobic interactions were found with ILE139A, ILE39A, and ALA40A.
					0	In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1.
					0	Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively.
					0	Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl).
					0	L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig.
					0	6).
					0	Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively.
Author	Reviewer_3	4	2	1	1	Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala40A, Ala44A, ALA44B and Lys47B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which are in close vicinity to the control arbutin and supports the literature [100-102].

					0	Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer.
					0	It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic 3 adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme 97-103.
					0	That’s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.

					0	Response: We appreciate the recommendation and updated the molecular docking study by adding more details and literature references as follows, 4.9.
					0	Molecular Docking Study Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96].
					0	To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed.
					0	It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-100].
					0	- Conclusion: Repeated abstract.
					0	The conclusion must remind the reader why the article was written in the first place and why it is important in the field.
					0	The conclusion should briefly give an insight into the obtained results and also the limitations.
					0	Response: We appreciate the recommendation and changed the conclusion as follows, 9 Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years.
					0	In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry.
					0	Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done.
					0	The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results.
					0	We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G of the ligands.
					0	The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules.
					0	Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable.
					0	To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent.
					0	The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule.
					0	Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view.
					0	We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands.
					0	We also revise the whole manuscript to make the language and grammar better as suggested by the reviewer.
