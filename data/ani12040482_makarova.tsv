					0	The manuscript: Impact of Changes in Owner Leaving Pattern on Separation- Related Behavior in Pet Dogs in the UK is one more paper on the behavior of dogs in the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the last two years.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	A catchy topic, but its content is unoriginal, bringing nothing new to the pre-pandemic science.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The content of the two papers Reviewer 1 mentions here focussed on the impact of the pandemic on management changes in dogs and on dog owner experiences at a single time point during the most restrictive ‘lockdown’.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	2	1	The current paper is different to either of these, and indeed any other published paper, in that it focusses on changes in separation related behaviour over time, across two different surveys in a longitudinal cohort.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	1	1	The paper is about separation-related behaviour, not about the pandemic.
					0	The changes in leaving routine that occurred during the pandemic afforded the opportunity to study what impact this had on a large population of pet dogs over time, that would otherwise have been impossible to capture at such scale.
					0	The topic is unique and important in that it adds evidence for an association that has previously been supposed or observed by individual practitioners, but not demonstrated in the published literature, and certainly not on this scale.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The entire first paragraph of Discussion repeats what has already been written in earlier chapters (line 372-379).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Yes, this was purposeful, it provides a summary of the aims & methods to introduce the discussion as not everyone reads papers in a linear fashion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We have not made any changes based on this statement.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 382-384 „To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence to show a link between changes in dogs’ leaving routines and risk of SRBs.” The authors take priority in the empirical demonstration of changes in dogs when the routine of the day is disturbed.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	And changing the routine of the day is a well-known factor influencing the dog's welfare and behavior, including the occurrence of separation anxiety, so the above-quoted sentence should be deleted because it is untrue.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	"The authors have hardly studied all the publications on how dogs behave when daily routines were changed, so the term ""first study"" is exaggerated."
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	There is a difference between something that is considered to be “well-known” or folk-knowledge and demonstrable evidence.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The sentence quoted here is not untrue, or exaggerated, however, if the Editor wishes us to explore this further, we would kindly request the Reviewer provide us with examples of publications where this has been empirically demonstrated, as we have not found any in our own searches.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Line 444 „This study has provided a unique and valuable insight into…..” the authors also mark their only unique role in the study, which does not bring new content.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Given the lack of constructive feedback in these statements, no changes have been made based on these comments.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	Final decision: reject
					0	This is a well written and clear manuscript which would be of interest to academics, practitioners and dog owners.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Abstract/simple summary: These are clear and well detailed.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	My only suggestion is that making it clear why February and October were chosen as survey-points may be beneficial.
					0	This is discussed later on but highlighting here would be useful.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Introduction: This is clear and in general provides a good background to the topic (bar a couple of points where more expansion would be beneficial).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Aa little more mention of issues of SRBs from owner perspective (e.g.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	noise complaints and issues with housing; property damage; decline of human-pet bond) could be beneficial (line 56-57).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	It may be helpful to discuss why there is poor owner adherence to programmes to reduce SRB (Line 66-67).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	I wasn't sure if line 79-80 was needed- about dogs having returned to pre-pandemic pattern, I think it is a little dismissive of your own research which is valuable and applicable beyond the pandemic.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Line 96-97- some more detail on the findings of these various surveys would be beneficial similarly to Bowen's study, just so provide a clear background/discussion of literature setting scene for your study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	Methods: This is generally well-detailed.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	It may be beneficial to make it clear why cut off of 'at least 5 mins' was used, e.g.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	justification for this/why this time duration used.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Line 131: There was an error with referencing wanted to flag.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	Study periods: It may be useful to spell out a little more here why these survey periods were chosen here, this is covered elsewhere but think could be made clearer here and earlier.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	Figure 1- Perhaps just double-check this is referred to in the text.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	Think either way this figure would benefit a bit of context on why was included/what was showing in context of this study as currently info is a bit generic and didn't totally tie into people's working from home etc.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	Results: These were generally well-detailed with clear layout considering scope of results.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	However, I don't think the figures were referred to in the text (unless that was the errors highlighted below?)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	12	0	2	There were some errors where reference source not found which would want to look into (line 246; 265; 274; 292; 305; 323 etc).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	Line 366-369= I'm not sure it's totally fair to interpret this (the dog not always bringing toy when greeting them) as an anthropomorphic interpretation on the part of the owner- the anthropomorphic interpretation seems to be from authors of manuscript not owner?
					0	They do not seem to state dog is favouring them less unless text was omitted here.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	Discussion: The results are appropriately discussed though perhaps more discussion about further study would be beneficial.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	I felt the discussion about changes in greeting behaviour as an early indicator was interesting and could be expanded.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	16	0	2	Some more detail on the application of the findings to practitioners/owners would be beneficial.
					0	I do think this is of interest to a range of stakeholders.

					0	The authors examined how separation-related behaviors in pet dogs changed in relation to time spent away from home by UK owners in February 2020 (pre-pandemic), May-July 2020 (first lockdown during the pandemic), and October-November 2020 (local tier-system for restrictions; follow-up).
					0	Their main finding is that close to 10% of dogs developed new signs of separation-related behaviors by the follow-up survey.
					0	The sample size is good, and the results are interesting.
					0	My specific comments are detailed below.
					0	I found the writing awkward in places.
					0	Here are some suggestions that can be made throughout the paper:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	Title: change “Leaving Pattern” to “Time Spent Away”; leaving pattern is less clear (it could be frequency of leaving each day)
Reviewer_4	Author	1	2	0	2	Line 27: change “reduced” to “decreased”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	3	0	2	Line 29: change “dogs whose leaving hours reduce most” to “dogs whose time left alone decreased most”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 30: change “leaving hours increase again” to “time left alone increased again”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	5	0	2	Line 214: if possible (might not be possible if this was how it was phrased in the survey), change “different to before” to “different from before”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	6	0	2	Lines 383-384: Change “dogs’ leaving routines” to “dogs’ time left alone” Materials and Methods:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	7	0	2	Line 151: how was the criterion of “at least 5 minutes” chosen?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	7	0	2	My main question when reading this section concerned how owners would know that certain separation-related behaviors occurred when they were away?
					0	There would be evidence for some behaviors, such as destructive behavior or defecation, but how would owners know about pacing or tail-chasing?
					0	This topic is not addressed until the Discussion section (line 395) but should be addressed here in the Methods and Materials section.
					0	Were behaviors, including different vocalizations, defined for owners?
					0	For example, what is the difference between pined, whined, and cried?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	8	0	2	Also, I might have missed it, but did all of these owners live alone with their dog(s), meaning no other people in the household?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	8	0	2	If other people were present, did all of them have to be away or just the dog’s owner?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	8	0	2	This information might be presented in your other paper, but it would be good to include this basic information here as well, so readers can better understand your methods and findings.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	9	0	2	Line 166: define “devolved nations” for readers unfamiliar with the term.
					0	Results:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	10	0	2	Figure 2: should the blank box for “Feb, Not at all” be 0.0%?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	11	0	2	Figure 4 is not called out in the text of the Results section.
					0	Conclusions:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	12	0	2	I believe Animals requires a Conclusions section.
					0	Minor issues:
Reviewer_4	Author	1	13	0	2	Line 35: insert “of” after 9.9%
Reviewer_4	Author	1	14	0	2	Line 100: insert “the” after “in”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	15	0	2	An error message occurred in several places (e.g., line 131, line 246, line 265)
Reviewer_4	Author	1	16	0	2	Line 148: change “focusses” to “focuses”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	17	0	2	Line 355: delete the first “the”
Reviewer_4	Author	1	18	0	2	Line 461: change “onto” to “on to”
					0	The study reports that pet dogs whose leaving routines changed most during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., their owners left them alone less frequently) would be at greater risk of developing separation-related behaviours following the lifting of pandemic restrictions.
					0	The authors gathered data (via owner surveys) about the same dogs before the pandemic, at the beginning of the pandemic and approx.
					0	5 months later.
					0	The article is generally well-written, the topic is timely, important, and interesting from a dog welfare aspect.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	1	0	2	However, currently, the paper seems too long, and it goes into too much detail about how the pandemic took place in the UK.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	2	0	2	This information would have been interesting if data on the mood, stress level, general mental health of the owners had also been collected in connection with the pandemic and the links with dog behaviour have been investigated.
					0	But the questionnaire only asked how long the dogs had been alone and what they were doing during this time.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	3	0	2	Therefore, the detailed description of the pandemic is unnecessary and could be moved to the Supplemental material, together with Figure 1.
					0	According to the authors, the main finding is that dogs whose leaving time reduced the most during the lockdown were most at risk of developing new SRBs.
					0	I think that according to the statistics, the strongest finding is that dogs who showed SRB in February or May had increased odds of having SRB during the subsequent measures which is not surprising.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	4	0	2	What is surprising though is that 55.7% of the dogs who were reported to show SRB in February (before the pandemic) were clear in October which is good news.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	4	0	2	However, the authors do not focus on this result and do not explain this finding.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	5	0	2	Specific points requiring attention: L18-20 „Whether dogs showed SRBs or not changed considerably over the months of the study, and one in ten dogs were found to have developed new SRBs in October, that they didn’t show before the pandemic” Overall, the percentage of dogs showing SRBs decreased during the study, and this should be clarified in the sentence above.
					0	What I see in Figure 4 and in the text is that approx.
					0	half of the dogs from the SRB group moved to the Clear group in October.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	6	0	2	L22 and elsewhere: dogs’ “leaving time” or “leaving hours” I think this expression is misleading because it is not the dogs that have left home, but the owners.
					0	But this is the opinion of a person using English as a second language.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	7	0	2	L33 10th instead of “10th”
Reviewer_5	Author	1	8	0	2	L45 Separation behaviour, separation-related behaviour, separation distress, separation anxiety terms are used interchangeably throughout the text, although these terms do not necessarily describe the same behaviours.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	8	0	2	Please provide a clear definition of the behaviour aimed to study and stick to one term.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	9	0	2	L92 delete the comma after Bowen et al.’s.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	10	0	2	L92-92 28.5% of dogs reported to have SRPs – this is a much higher number than mentioned in previous studies and needs to be discussed.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	11	0	2	L118 Materials and Methods This section (after the Ethics) should begin with the Subjects section.
					0	It is confusing to read about the surveys without knowing the sample sizes per survey and the demographics.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	12	0	2	L127-137 The dates of data collections have been already mentioned in L121-126, so there is no need for repeating them.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	12	0	2	The whole section is not relevant to the main question.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	13	0	2	L131-132 and elsewhere: (Error!
Reviewer_5	Author	1	13	0	2	Reference source not found.)
Reviewer_5	Author	1	13	0	2	This error occurs 7 times in the text, please correct.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	14	0	2	L148 Please explain why a periof of 7 days were asked to be reported
Reviewer_5	Author	1	15	0	2	L165-167 Figure 1.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	15	0	2	This Figure should be moved to the Supplement material as it tells nothing about the dogs’ behaviour.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	16	0	2	L216-218 “The text was then coded by two researchers” I could not find agreement data reported later.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	17	0	2	L238 Do the authors have information about the Owner demographics?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	17	0	2	What was the proportion of females?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	17	0	2	Was there a relationship between age and leaving hours?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	17	0	2	Or explain why this information has not been used.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	18	0	2	L232-242 These sections should be moved to the Materials and Methods as a “Subjects” section
Reviewer_5	Author	1	19	0	2	L232 How many owners have filled in the questionnaire altogether?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	20	0	2	What was the proportion of owners who did not leave their dog at home before the pandemic?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	21	0	2	Why were they excluded?
					0	It is perfectly feasible that some owners did not leave their homes because they were for example, ill, but they did so during the pandemic.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	22	0	2	What was the proportion of owners who indicated that they would like to participate in the follow-up study?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	23	0	2	Among them, what was the proportion of owners who has not responded to the request afterward?
Reviewer_5	Author	1	24	0	2	L278-280 “There were 1,407 dogs who were clear of SRB at baseline in February 2020.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	24	0	2	When looking at SRB status in October, of 1,187 dogs who were left alone in October, 117 (9.9%) were reported to have shown at least one SRB”.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	24	0	2	In other words, 1407/1807 (78%) of dogs were clear of SRB in February and 90.1% in October.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	24	0	2	This is good news, and it is unclear for me why is it reported as bad news.
					0	The next section (l281-283) emphasizes that 55.7% of the dogs who were reported to show SRB in February were clear in October.
					0	This is a big improvement, I think.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	25	0	2	L285 Figure 4.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	25	0	2	This is a great figure, thank you for including it.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	25	0	2	However, an explanation would be useful for those readers who are not familiar with this type of depicting.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	26	0	2	L291 The odds ratio (OR) is 5.38 and not 4.38 in Table 1.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	27	0	2	L293-295 “The final variable associated with October SRB status was the difference in the number of days dogs were left alone for between the February baseline and lockdown”.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	27	0	2	OR was 0.81 here.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	27	0	2	Please explain the relationship between the variables.
Reviewer_5	Author	1	28	0	2	L298 Table 1 legend: Add what bold indicates

					0	I think that after the revision, the paper would make an interesting contribution to the journal.
					0	I hope this review helps – thank you for the opportunity.
					0	As I wrote in the previous manuscript review: “Impact of changes in time left alone on separation-related behaviour in UK pet dogs” is one more paper on the behavior of dogs in the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the last two years.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	Manuscript has been slightly improved, but my comments were not included.
					0	The authors still take priority in the empirical demonstration of changes in dogs when the routine of the day is disturbed.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	My final decision: reject Comments for author File: Comments.docx
					0	This is a well written and clear manuscript which would be of interest to academics, practitioners and dog owners.
					0	Thank you for your comments and for the constructive feedback.
					0	We have addressed each one below.
					0	Abstract/simple summary: These are clear and well detailed.
					0	My only suggestion is that making it clear why February and October were chosen as survey-points may be beneficial.
					0	This is discussed later on but highlighting here would be useful.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	1	1	Thank you, in line 16 and 32 we have added “when restrictions had eased” to explain why we surveyed in October 2020.
					0	Introduction: This is clear and in general provides a good background to the topic (bar a couple of points where more expansion would be beneficial).
					0	Aa little more mention of issues of SRBs from owner perspective (e.g.
					0	noise complaints and issues with housing; property damage; decline of human-pet bond) could be beneficial (line 56-57).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	3	1	Thank you, we have now expanded this to read: “In addition to being a welfare concern for the dog, SRBs are often unwanted or problematic for the owner and/or neighbours such as in the case of excessive vocalisation, which may lead to noise complaints, or in terms of house soiling and destruction of property, which may be particularly problematic for people living in rental accommodation. In such cases, these issues may increase risk of relinquishment [7]” (see new lines 56-59) It may be helpful to discuss why there is poor owner adherence to programmes to reduce SRB (Line 66-67).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	4	1	The following text has now been added beginning at line 69: “Whilst the precise reasons for poor adherence to advice for preventing or reducing SRBs have not been documented, it is at least partly attributed to the relative difficulty of adhering to specific aspects of these programmes, with the easier pieces of advice followed more often than the parts that take more commitment and consideration [13].” I wasn't sure if line 79-80 was needed- about dogs having returned to pre-pandemic pattern, I think it is a little dismissive of your own research which is valuable and applicable beyond the pandemic.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	5	1	Thank you for your comment, I think we were pre-judging that people would think it was just another covid paper, and we are glad to see you agree with us that it is valuable beyond the pandemic.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	5	1	This line has now been deleted.
					0	Line 96-97- some more detail on the findings of these various surveys would be beneficial similarly to Bowen's study, just so provide a clear background/discussion of literature setting scene for your study.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	6	1	The findings were all extremely similar, so it felt quite repetitive to discuss them all.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	6	1	We actually had more detail in an early draft then trimmed it out.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	6	1	However, we have now added some more of this detail as requested (see lines 100 to 112), whilst trying to limit repetition.
					0	Methods: This is generally well-detailed.
					0	It may be beneficial to make it clear why cut off of 'at least 5 mins' was used, e.g justification for this/why this time duration used.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	7	1	We presumed that at some point owners would pop out of the house, to take out the bin or go to the garage etc..
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	7	1	Such leaving events are likely to be experienced differently by some dogs, as the owners won’t likely give off the same cues as when they leave for an extended period of time, such as picking up house keys, or leaving through a different door.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	7	1	This has been explained now in lines 179-83.
					0	Line 131: There was an error with referencing wanted to flag.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	8	1	Thank you, this seemed ok when we submitted it, but must have gone wrong when uploaded but we’ve corrected it now.
					0	Study periods: It may be useful to spell out a little more here why these survey periods were chosen here, this is covered elsewhere but think could be made clearer here and earlier.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	9	1	We’ve amended description of the study periods in a few places, including between lines 132-142, which we hope addresses this query now.
					0	Figure 1- Perhaps just double-check this is referred to in the text.
					0	Think either way this figure would benefit a bit of context on why was included/what was showing in context of this study as currently info is a bit generic and didn't totally tie into people's working from home etc.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	10	1	One of the other reviewers also commented on this and asked for Figure 1 and much of the text to be moved to the supplemental material, so
Author	Reviewer_5	2	61	15	1	this has been done now.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	10	1	It’s also further explained in the supplementary material how it links to working and in lines 140-142 in the main text which now explains that many businesses were open again in October.
					0	Results: These were generally well-detailed with clear layout considering scope of results.
					0	However, I don't think the figures were referred to in the text (unless that was the errors highlighted below?)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	11	1	This was due to the errors you mentioned below.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	11	1	We used the Word automatic referencing and somehow that seemed to get broken when the document was uploaded to the online system.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	16	11	1	It’s been done manually now.
					0	There were some errors where reference source not found, which would want to look into (line 246; 265; 274; 292; 305; 323 etc).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	12	1	See above.
					0	Line 366-369= I'm not sure it's totally fair to interpret this (the dog not always bringing toy when greeting them) as an anthropomorphic interpretation on the part of the owner- the anthropomorphic interpretation seems to be from authors of manuscript not owner?
					0	They do not seem to state dog is favouring them less unless text was omitted here.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	13	1	Agreed, this was how we interpreted why the owner was reporting this change.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	13	1	We have rephrased this section now.
					0	Discussion: The results are appropriately discussed though perhaps more discussion about further study would be beneficial.
					0	I felt the discussion about changes in greeting behaviour as an early indicator was interesting and could be expanded.
					0	Some more detail on the application of the findings to practitioners/owners would be beneficial.
					0	I do think this is of interest to a range of stakeholders.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	16	1	Thank you for your review.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	16	1	We have expanded the discussion to address these points, however due to another reviewer saying the paper was already too long, we have kept this brief.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	16	1	A section detailing relevance to practitioners has been added to lines 545-551.
					0	The article, “Impact of Changes in Owner Leaving Pattern on Separation-Related Behaviour in Pet Dogs in the UK” investigated whether the prevalence of SRB in dogs changed with changes in dog management during and after COVID lockdowns.
					0	The authors found that owners reported that nearly 10% of dogs that did not show SRB behaviors prior to lockdown were reported to show SRB after lockdown, and the greater the change in the dog’s routine, the greater chance they had of showing new SRB.
					0	I have minor comments below and a few larger comments:
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	P1 L29 and P3 L112 the present tense “reduce” sounds strange to me here.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	I would suggest “reduced” since you are looking at changes that have already occurred.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	P6 L176 I am assuming you excluded dogs that were not left alone in February (or were there none?)
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	P10 L307-308 Could you make this a positive statement to show highlight the impact of amount of change on SRB: Dogs whose days left alone per week increased the most…If the data support that angle, I think it’s a stronger statement than what is written.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Larger issues: I would like to see the authors address a few different angles in the discussion 1.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	That dogs showing SRB prior to lockdown were more likely to show it after.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Suggests the behavior is fairly robust and dogs having shown it at one point continue to be at risk (without knowing what interventions were taken) 2.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Can you address the dogs that improved between Feb and Oct?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	You report the number of new dogs showing SRB but can you report on dogs that went the other way?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	What was the actual # and %?
					0	This comparison seems essential—if some dogs gets worse but some get better, than the argument that changes due to COVID might bring about new SRB becomes weaker.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	It seems you have compared within dogs that showed SRB in baseline and other models for dogs that did not.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Seems a comparison between SRB- (baseline) → SRB + (post lockdown) and SRB + (baseline) → SRB- (post lockdown) dogs is critical and missing.
					0	3.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	One of the challenges in this is we don’t know background rates of change for dogs with SRB.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	That is, would the same % of dogs changed (in either direction) regardless of changes in owner schedules?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	We might see some dogs become sensitized over time and develop SRB (or something else changes in their life to precipitate it), while others might habituate or their behavior undergo extinction.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	As such, we can’t say for certain that these changes are due to changes in owner schedule.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	You note that the pseudo-R2 was small but I think you could go into more details and note the possibility that it was unrelated too.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	However, your results that the greater the change → the greater the new risk of SRB does lend support to the idea that this change in management might be a factor.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	I would suggest highlighting and discussing this outcome more.

Author	Reviewer_3	2	24	3	1	Within the results table (Table 2) the direction of the estimate for this result is negative.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	24	3	1	Whilst we agree that it would be more impactful worded the other way around, we worry that changing the way it is described won’t match up to the data as it was coded and reported.

Author	Reviewer_3	2	26	5	1	Thank you for these thoughtful comments, we agree that we were a bit overly focussed on the results that supported the studies hypothesis and neglected to discuss the findings related to the dogs whose SRB appeared to have resolved.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	26	5	1	The number and percentage are detailed in the results section (lines 282-283 of the original submission and 298-298 in this one), but we failed to discuss these in the Discussion.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	26	5	1	We ran two models, one focussing on the dogs who started SRB- to see how many changed to SRB+ or remained SRB- and what factors influenced this, and the other focussing on dogs that started SRB+ to see what factors influence whether they changed to SRB- or remained SRB+.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	26	5	1	These models therefore, cover the comparisons you suggest (unless we’ve misinterpreted your comments).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	26	5	1	We have now added some discussion of the dogs who began the pandemic SRB+ however, as this was lacking from the first version (see the paragraph beginning at line 524).

Author	Reviewer_3	2	27	6	1	Thank you for this comment, we have discussed this further in the Discussion now (see lines 517-523)
					0	The authors examined how separation-related behaviors in pet dogs changed in relation to time spent away from home by UK owners in February 2020 (pre-pandemic), May-July 2020 (first lockdown during the pandemic), and October-November 2020 (local tier-system for restrictions; follow-up).
					0	Their main finding is that close to 10% of dogs developed new signs of separation-related behaviors by the follow-up survey.
					0	The sample size is good, and the results are interesting.
					0	My specific comments are detailed below.
					0	I found the writing awkward in places.
					0	Here are some suggestions that can be made throughout the paper: Title: change “Leaving Pattern” to “Time Spent Away”; leaving pattern is less clear (it could be frequency of leaving each day)
Author	Reviewer_4	2	28	1	1	Thank you, we have changed the title to: Impact of changes in time left alone on separation-related behaviour in UK pet dogs
					0	 Line 27: change “reduced” to “decreased” Thank you, this edit has been applied.
					0	Line 29: change “dogs whose leaving hours reduce most” to “dogs whose time left alone decreased most” Thank you, this edit has been applied.
					0	Line 30: change “leaving hours increase again” to “time left alone increased again” Thank you, this edit has been applied.
					0	Line 214: if possible (might not be possible if this was how it was phrased in the survey), change “different to before” to “different from before”
Author	Reviewer_4	2	32	5	1	This is how it was phrased in the survey, so this has not been changed.
					0	Lines 383-384: Change “dogs’ leaving routines” to “dogs’ time left alone” Thank you, this edit has been applied.
					0	Materials and Methods: Line 151: how was the criterion of “at least 5 minutes” chosen?
Author	Reviewer_4	2	34	7	1	It seemed unfeasible to expect a dog to never be left for even a minute or two, for example if the owner pops outside to take out the bin or to get something from the garage/shed etc.
					0	My main question when reading this section concerned how owners would know that certain separation-related behaviors occurred when they were away?
					0	There would be evidence for some behaviors, such as destructive behavior or defecation, but how would owners know about pacing or tail-chasing?
					0	This topic is not addressed until the Discussion section (line 395) but should be addressed here in the Methods and Materials section.
					0	Were behaviors, including different vocalizations, defined for owners?
					0	For example, what is the difference between pined, whined, and cried?
Author	Reviewer_4	2	35	7	1	The wording given to the owners is all presented here, and in the supplementary material.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	35	7	1	No further definitions for behaviours or vocalisations were given.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	35	7	1	Pined, whined and cried were all mentioned, as all are words owner tend to use to describe similar dog vocalisations.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	35	7	1	As with all owner awareness of SRBs, it is fundamentally challenging unless they use recording equipment to view their dogs when they leave them or are otherwise able to view their dogs when alone such as by looking through a window.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	35	7	1	As this is a limitation of the method used, the appropriate place to mention this would be in the Discussion, not the Methods, so we have not discussed this limitation there.
					0	Also, I might have missed it, but did all of these owners live alone with their dog(s), meaning no other people in the household?
					0	If other people were present, did all of them have to be away or just the dog’s owner?
					0	This information might be presented in your other paper, but it would be good to include this basic information here as well, so readers can better understand your methods and findings.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	36	8	1	The wording of the question asked about the dog being left alone, without human company (see line 173), so it applied to anyone, and specifically meant when no-human was present in the house with the dog.
					0	Line 166: define “devolved nations” for readers unfamiliar with the term.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	37	9	1	This has now been explained, however this section has been moved entirely to the supplementary material on request of other reviewers.

Author	Reviewer_4	2	38	10	1	Not strictly speaking, no.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	38	10	1	Dogs who were not left in February were excluded from the analysis.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	38	10	1	So, whilst there are 0 of them, that’s because of methodological choice not because there weren’t any dogs left alone.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	38	10	1	A note explaining this has been added to the figure legend.
					0	Figure 4 is not called out in the text of the Results section.

					0	The study reports that pet dogs whose leaving routines changed most during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., their owners left them alone less frequently) would be at greater risk of developing separation-related behaviours following the lifting of pandemic restrictions.
					0	The authors gathered data (via owner surveys) about the same dogs before the pandemic, at the beginning of the pandemic and approx.
					0	5 months later.
					0	The article is generally well-written, the topic is timely, important, and interesting from a dog welfare aspect.
					0	However, currently, the paper seems too long, and it goes into too much detail about how the pandemic took place in the UK.
					0	This information would have been interesting if data on the mood, stress level, general mental health of the owners had also been collected in connection with the pandemic and the links with dog behaviour have been investigated.
					0	But the questionnaire only asked how long the dogs had been alone and what they were doing during this time.
					0	Therefore, the detailed description of the pandemic is unnecessary and could be moved to the Supplemental material, together with Figure 1.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	49	3	1	Thank you for your comments. The detail was provided to anchor the study in the background of what was occurring at the time, but we agree it is not necessary to the reader to see in the main text. These details and Figure 1 have been moved to the Supplementary material.
					0	According to the authors, the main finding is that dogs whose leaving time reduced the most during the lockdown were most at risk of developing new SRBs.
					0	I think that according to the statistics, the strongest finding is that dogs who showed SRB in February or May had increased odds of having SRB during the subsequent measures which is not surprising.
					0	What is surprising though is that 55.7% of the dogs who were reported to show SRB in February (before the pandemic) were clear in October which is good news.
					0	However, the authors do not focus on this result and do not explain this finding.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	50	4	1	We agree this was completely missed from the Discussion.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	50	4	1	It wasn’t intentional, we were just overly focussed on the results that related to the research hypothesis.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	50	4	1	Discussion around this has been added now to lines 524-544.
					0	Specific points requiring attention: L18-20 „Whether dogs showed SRBs or not changed considerably over the months of the study, and one in ten dogs were found to have developed new SRBs in October, that they didn’t show before the pandemic” Overall, the percentage of dogs showing SRBs decreased during the study, and this should be clarified in the sentence above.
					0	What I see in Figure 4 and in the text is that approx.
					0	half of the dogs from the SRB group moved to the Clear group in October.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	51	5	1	Agreed, we have altered this part of the simple summary and abstract and included discussion of this in lines 539-544 now as well as into the conclusions, thank you.
					0	L22 and elsewhere: dogs’ “leaving time” or “leaving hours” I think this expression is misleading because it is not the dogs that have left home, but the owners.
					0	But this is the opinion of a person using English as a second language.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	75	29	1	Thank you!
Author	Reviewer_5	2	52	6	1	Leaving time has been changed throughout to ‘time left alone’ L33 10th instead of “10th” Thank you, we’ve corrected the typo.
					0	L45 Separation behaviour, separation-related behaviour, separation distress, separation anxiety terms are used interchangeably throughout the text, although these terms do not necessarily describe the same behaviours.
					0	Please provide a clear definition of the behaviour aimed to study and stick to one term.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	Thank you for pointing this out.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	We define SRB in the opening lines of the Introduction (45-50), however you are right that in places the terms can get confusing.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	Section 3.7.3. details behaviours owners reported as associated with separation, that are not what class as SRBs.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	Those were names ‘other’ separation behaviour but this has now been clarified, hopefully, by remaining the section ‘Other’ separation-linked behaviour, and then in the text it is now stated they are not SRBs.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	The term ‘separation anxiety’ was used in the introduction where it referenced a study that used that specific term.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	This has now been put into quote marks to be clear it is their term, not ours.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	54	8	1	The one mention of separation-distress has also now been changed.
					0	L92 delete the comma after Bowen et al.’s.
					0	Thank you, we’ve corrected the typo.
					0	L92-92 28.5% of dogs reported to have SRPs – this is a much higher number than mentioned in previous studies and needs to be discussed.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	56	10	1	This has now been discussed further in lines 98-100.
					0	L118 Materials and Methods This section (after the Ethics) should begin with the Subjects section.

Author	Reviewer_5	2	57	11	1	This has now been moved to the beginning of the methods section.
					0	L127-137 The dates of data collections have been already mentioned in L121-126, so there is no need for repeating them.

					0	L148 Please explain why a period of 7 days were asked to be reported
Author	Reviewer_5	2	60	14	1	We asked about the dogs’ management and behaviour over the previous 7 days so as to limit recall bias and anchor the data to a specific snapshot of time, rather than being more general.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	60	14	1	This was first asked for the first survey which was specifically looking at changes in management and behaviour during the strict lockdown period, so needed to be time specific.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	60	14	1	Questions were then repeated in the follow-up survey.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	60	14	1	Wording has been added to lines 165-169 now to clarify this.
					0	L165-167 Figure 1.
					0	This Figure should be moved to the Supplement material as it tells nothing about the dogs’ behaviour.
					0	This has been done now.
					0	L216-218 “The text was then coded by two researchers” I could not find agreement data reported later.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	62	16	1	Thank you for spotting this, we have updated both the methods (L243-247) and results section (L370-374) with further detail of inter-rater reliability checks.
					0	L238 Do the authors have information about the Owner demographics?
					0	What was the proportion of females?
					0	Was there a relationship between age and leaving hours?
					0	Or explain why this information has not been used.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	63	17	1	At the end of survey 1 there was the option for people to provide their demographic details, which not everyone did.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	63	17	1	This was done to conform to GDPR by asking only the most necessary questions.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	63	17	1	Given that the research question here is related to the dogs’ behaviour change over time versus leaving hours, it wasn’t deemed relevant to include analysis of the owner demographics.
					0	L232-242 These sections should be moved to the Materials and Methods as a “Subjects” section
Author	Reviewer_5	2	64	18	1	This has now been done.
					0	L232 How many owners have filled in the questionnaire altogether?
					0	What was the proportion of owners who did not leave their dog at home before the pandemic?
					0	Why were they excluded?
					0	It is perfectly feasible that some owners did not leave their homes because they were for example, ill, but they did so during the pandemic.
					0	What was the proportion of owners who indicated that they would like to participate in the follow-up study?
					0	Among them, what was the proportion of owners who has not responded to the request afterward?
Author	Reviewer_5	2	69	23	1	For the purpose of this study it was required that we had baseline data on the dogs’ leaving behaviour so that we could classify them as SRB+ or – before the pandemic began.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	69	23	1	Owners of dogs who were not left alone in a typical week in February, were not asked about their dogs’ separation-related behaviour, so we did not have these data for them which is why they were excluded.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	69	23	1	New text has been added to the Subjects section of the methodology to explain how many owners answered the follow up questionnaire, the response rate and what percentage and number of dogs were not left home alone before the pandemic.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	69	23	1	The new section beginning at line 146 now reads: “A total of 2,425 people completed the follow-up survey for the same dog they scored in the original survey (a 51.9% response rate), of which 2,285 had previously provided data to indicate whether their dog was left alone or not in February 2020.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	69	23	1	Of these, 15.3% dogs (n=305) were not left alone at all in an average week in February, and as such, these dogs did not have baseline data for their behaviour when left so were excluded from further analysis.” Additionally, the number of people we emailed the invitation to (n=4,670) has been added to line 139.
					0	L278-280 “There were 1,407 dogs who were clear of SRB at baseline in February 2020.
					0	When looking at SRB status in October, of 1,187 dogs who were left alone in October, 117 (9.9%) were reported to have shown at least one SRB”.
					0	In other words, 1407/1807 (78%) of dogs were clear of SRB in February and 90.1% in October.
					0	This is good news, and it is unclear for me why is it reported as bad news.
					0	The next section (l281-283) emphasizes that 55.7% of the dogs who were reported to show SRB in February were clear in October.
					0	This is a big improvement, I think.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	70	24	1	For the 1407 dogs who were clear of SRB in February, they changed from being 100% clear to being 90.1% clear, with 1 in 10 of these dogs developing SRB they didn’t have previously.
Author	Reviewer_5	2	70	24	1	However, because of the dramatic improvement seen in the dogs that had SRB before the pandemic, the overall prevalence of SRB in the population decreased from 22% in February, to 17.2% in October (reported in the paragraph above).
Author	Reviewer_5	2	70	24	1	The numbers have been clarified in this section to help future readers, and additional discussion has been added around the overall decrease in SRB prevalence in both the abstract and in the discussion (lines 524-544).
					0	L285 Figure 4.
					0	This is a great figure, thank you for including it.
