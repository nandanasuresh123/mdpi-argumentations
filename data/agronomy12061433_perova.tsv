					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	1	1	We better clarified this in the method section (L101, L105-106).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	1	1	2000 is the year of the establishment of Conservation and Safety Network.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	1	1	In this frame, seeds were collected and maintained in long term storage conditions by Arsial in the subsequent years.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	How many seeds were collected?
					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	2	1	Between 8-10 grams (about 2000 seeds) we don’t think is a detail to insert in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	line 115: Did one repetition mean one plant?
					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	3	1	Yes, we clarified (L116).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	line 130: How many fruits were used as a sample of representative fruits?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	line 135: How many fruits were used as a bulk of representative fruits?
					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	5	1	We added these details (L132 and L136)
					0	 The results are described and discussed in detail.
					0	#Answer: Thanks We hope that these revisions successfully address the raised concerns, remaining available for any other requests regarding the manuscript.

					0	1)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The introduction part is a bit long, although it states the importance of this local variety of sweet pepper and of tracing its origin.
					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	1	1	We prefer to keep the introduction in order to give a broad overview to readers
					0	 2)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	In figure 3: why CP cultivars in purple lines are clustered with CC and MG in green?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Any explanation?
					0	#Answer:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	2	1	"The cluster analysis is based on phenotypic traits, this analysis revealed specific clusters of ""Cornetto di Pontecorvo"" and similar types, although they were not clearly separated at the hierarchical level."
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	2	1	The genotyping analysis provided more in-depth insights.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	2	1	We addressed this in the discussions section (see L485 and subsequent).
